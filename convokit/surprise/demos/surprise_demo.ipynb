    "Computing Surprise With ConvoKit\n",
    "=====================\n",
    "This notebook provides a demo of how to use the Surprise transformer to compute surprise across a corpus. The transformer currently only allows computation of how surprising a speaker's utterances in one conversation (target) are compared to their utterances in all other conversations (context) in the corpus. Eventually, the functionality of the Surprise transformer will be abstracted to allow for computation of surprise between any target and context types."

Know an AEP guy who was turned off from ChemE by it, so since you&#39;re not even considering ChemE you might as well take the AP credit. I did that and have not regretted it.  \n\nAlso, do not take 1116 and 2217 the same semester. I mean, whether you do is up to you, but almost no one does this and it is not recommended due to the workload. If you really want to get ahead in AEP and you have the prerequisites, double up on maths (2930 and 2940) and if you have credit for those go straight into the AEP Major (MatPhys 4210 or Circuits 3630). If you have any other questions about AEP feel free to ask!\n\nSpeaker: cryptkeep, Conversation: 3zgnom, Surprise: 2.596652486329722\nI don&#39;t believe there is a minimum GPA requirement, but if you are applying to transfer, the key is really going to be articulating why coming to Cornell will allow you to achieve your goals in a way the University of Michigan never could. Look, every college within Cornell is different. Arts &amp;amp; Sciences will definitely be more demanding than Human Ecology just by the nature of the courses you take.\n\nIf you are looking to get away from UMich because it is too difficult for you, Cornell is not the place for you. However, if you&#39;re looking for a challenge, you&#39;ve found the right place.\n\nAlso, I like to think of it this way: if you are going to transfer, why would you switch to a school you don&#39;t really even want to be in to begin with? If you want to be in Arts &amp;amp; Sciences, apply. If you want to be in HumEc, take the transfer option.\n\nSpeaker: rwaterbender, Conversation: 9ora8i, Surprise: 2.5605134443163844\na) You can&#39;t minor in AEP (but you can minor in physics)  \nb) It is not a huge deal to take 2213 instead of 17  \nc) No one doubles in AEP/ECE because of content overlap and redundancy. I would suggest you pick one or minor in ECE, which is not unheard of but also redundant.  \nd) Taking ECE 2100 and 2300 will mean you don&#39;t have to take AEP circuits. If you are considering the ECE minor, this is another reason to do it.   \nI personally would advise you to either major in AEP and minor in ECE, or just major in ECE and take whatever physics you want. Going from that, if you major in AEP you can take 2100 whenever, and if you major in ECE there is no need to take 2217. Either way your problem is solved. \n\nSpeaker: Fencerman2, Conversation: 92rvm5, Surprise: 2.537094990036482\nAll of the other responses here are spot-on but there is one thing I&#39;d like to add. There are a lot of goofy and fun events during O-week that you won&#39;t have the chance to do again. A lot of people go and party all of O-week, and apparently it can be tough to find a place to let you in because of sheer crowds. If you want to go out, go for it, but don&#39;t let it cut in to other things you want to try during O-week. There&#39;s a party somewhere every weekend if you want it, but you only get one freshman O-week.\n\nSpeaker: laveritecestla, Conversation: 6v857y, Surprise: 2.508444324123055\nPlease place all admissions related posts here, in the form of comments, and current Cornell students will reply. Try to be detailed; if we don&#39;t have enough information, we can&#39;t help. Also, if you are a prospective student, and have questions about life at Cornell, feel free to post them here!\n\nAny &quot;Chance Me&quot; or admissions related posts placed elsewhere will be removed. This thread will be be unpinned and replaced with a new one every two weeks.\n\nIf you are a current student, and think that you could offer advice to someone considering Cornell, feel free to respond to some of the posts! Please only respond if you are qualified to do so. I will be checking through these regularly for spam.\n\nSpeaker: CornellMan333, Conversation: 9j2exy, Surprise: 2.5009804877604136\nPhysics vs AEP\n\nSo Iâ€™m a sophomore majoring in both physics and CS in the college of arts and sciences. \n\nMy problem is that I love physics, but I hate research. Itâ€™s just so much work for so little results. \n\nAnd since I hate research, I donâ€™t plan on going on to get a PhD in physics like I did when I first came to this university. So I see no physics in my future beyond that in my classes of my senior year. \n\nHowever, if I transfer to the engineering college and major in AEP, Iâ€™m under the impression that I will be able to actually do physics after college in the form of engineering. \n\nBut if I do transfer to AEP, I fear that I wonâ€™t be able to double major in CS and AEP like Iâ€™m able to now. And yes, I do want the double major, not a concentration in one or the other. I love both CS and physics with the same intensity. \n\nWhat do? What physics related jobs can you do with a bachelors in non-engineering physics and no physics PhD? Right. So I want to do engineering if I do want a physics related job without a PhD. Or I could just get an engineering masters later, but thatâ€™s expensive.  Yeah I was considering just doing that, but itâ€™s expensive :(\n\nSpeaker: rwaterbender, Conversation: 9oz71e, Surprise: 2.481043927214716\nI think you are actually in a good position. You have plenty of time for a CS minor and I think you may even be able to get an internship this year. Here&#39;s what I would recommend if you want to go into CS (which you can with just a minor): take 2110, DO NOT TAKE 2800 NEXT SEMESTER, take 5150. This will give you practical experience for any internship you might land. If you additionally want to take 2800 though that will set you up well for the future.  Everything requires 2110 as a prereq, except 2800. Take it anyways if you have a strong grasp of python. If you want to get up to speed in the field it&#39;s expected you&#39;ll have to do some things like this and read ahead since you&#39;re 2 years behind. Try and find the classes that you can do in python or whatever languages you know or are willing to learn. \n\nSpeaker: Fencerman2, Conversation: 6g3p38, Surprise: 2.4682977265860284\nImo, the best way to boost your chances is to show your passion about what it is you do in your free time. If you are genuinely interested in joining a club now, then go for it. But don&#39;t just join clubs left and right hoping for Cornell to miss the fact that you mysteriously loaded up on things senior year. Same is true for your essay - if you are passionate about your family and financial reasons for your grades, by all means write about it. If not, then focus on something you can ramble on about until you have filled the space you want to fill. Demonstrate your passion and your involvement, and if you are right for Cornell and Cornell is right for you, you could very well find yourself there. Good luck!\n\nSpeaker: Fencerman2, Conversation: 99dspg, Surprise: 2.46358797154727\nIf you swap in that case, you would need to stay in the same discussion you are already enrolled in and just swap the lecture. Make sure you are selecting the same section even if there are two at the same time.\n\nIf that doesnâ€™t work, then it is probably a shortcoming of student center, and youâ€™d have to work it out with the professor or hope someone drops. All courses will make you enter both, but if the discussion sections are specific to the lecture (which I havenâ€™t heard of before but Iâ€™m sure it exists), and all discussions for one lecture are full, you wonâ€™t be able to switch into that lecture. Hope something opens up for you!\n\nSpeaker: agarcia900, Conversation: 60wqtn, Surprise: 2.4497516088582616\nIt&#39;s something you should talk about with your family instead. If you and them are willing to pay that much for college then it would be worth it. Alot of other good schools might be that price too.\n\n If you&#39;re in NY I think it&#39;s cheaper though, like $30,000.  A creative writing minor? Or maybe classes in the communication major as electives It&#39;s based on what you think it will be worth. If you like Cornell more and can pay for it then go for Cornell. I believe that the prestige of both is high and it depends on the major  Why wouldn&#39;t it be? (Although it depends on what the other school you&#39;ll be attending is and if you like it there more)\n\nIt might be better because you can get distribution credits or intro major classes done at other schools \n\n"

      "text/plain": "research experience after graduating. I was lucky, and most of the research done in my field is dry, rather than bench. But if you&#39;re in something like biochem or molecular bio, you&#39;ll want that bench experience.&quot;,\n &quot;Swapping a bio class to pass/fail would almost certainly be a huge disqualification. It&#39;s better to take the crappy grade and retake the course.&quot;,\n &#39;https://isso.cornell.edu/students/working-us/f1-internships-cpt&#39;,\n &quot;You could. The only thing that it would save is your GPA, and while I&#39;m not positive, I&#39;m sure that it would still be a huge blemish. I&#39;m also positive that med school adcoms have some way of putting S/U courses into context.&quot;,\n &quot;I would advise against using a fake. The bars and liquor stores around Ithaca are really strict about it, and even though they probably don&#39;t have a lot of experience picking out the fake international IDs, I wouldn&#39;t play Russian Roulette with them.&quot;,\n &quot;Congrats to all the admits! If anyone is in the Cleveland area who wants to know more about Cornell, the bio major, and how it&#39;s like being a pre-med, feel free to message me to set up a meeting!&quot;,\n &quot;I only know for CAS, but from what I recall, getting off the waitlist into the fall entering class is really rare. It&#39;s more likely to get a spring admit offer or a guaranteed transfer offer than it is to get off the waitlist. If you don&#39;t get either and go through the normal transfer process, I believe that being waitlisted from Cornell does factor (slightly) into the decision process.&quot;,\n &#39;Chemistry, from what I understand (and I could be wrong), opens more doors in the chemical field (obviously), but not so much in the biological side of chemistry (unless you focus on biochem). The biochem concentration will still show up as a bio major on your degree, and so it will open a lot of doors for you in terms of the bio job market, but less so in the chemical market.\\n\\nI would probably say chem is better for job prospects, if you can handle the work. Chem is just as difficult, if not more so, than the biology major. &#39;,\n &quot;&amp;gt; Also, I realize drop deadline has passed, but I think I should be able to make a convincing appeal request given my late decision on the premed track.\\n\\nThey probably won&#39;t accept it, but you can give it a try. Many people change their majors, drop/add pre-med, etc. during their time as a student. Your case isn&#39;t unique or special.\\n\\nUnfortunately, beyond that, I don&#39;t really have any suggestions. I personally would take the drop over a bad grade, and then explain that in your med school application. &quot;,\n &#39;Half my fraternity were engineers. So yes, they can have fun.&#39;,\n &quot;You should check with Engineering concerning transfer credits. I&#39;m not sure what their policies are, but there&#39;s a fair chance you won&#39;t be able to use some of your credits (FWS stand out in particular).\\n\\nMost engineers I know took at least 4 courses their freshman year, in additional to a PE course. Later on, many easily took at least 18 credits per semester, even though they came in with additional AP credits. While it is possible to skate by doing 15 credits per semester, the reality is that a fair number of engineers do hit 18 credits or more per semester for at least one semester here.&quot;,\n &quot;[This has specifics for Engineering.](http://courses.cornell.edu/content.php?catoid=28&amp;amp;navoid=7192#General_Policies_for_Transfer_Credit)\\n\\nIf you took your classes through the Summer Program for high school students at Cornell, then it should count, but I would double check with your college&#39;s registrar first.&quot;,\n &quot;Seminar courses are (typically, though not always) just involve having speakers about topics covered by that seminar (e.g. Seminar in Genomics might have a few speakers that cover various research and recent developments in genomics). No homework and fairly low-key, graded S/U. They&#39;re pretty good to pick-up if you want to learn more about a subject, but they don&#39;t count toward your credit/course total towards graduation IIRC.&quot;,\n &#39;No. &#39;,\n &quot;I was a pre-med at Cornell for about 6 semesters. I can tell you that truthfully, it is fairly stressful, particularly in your sophomore and/or junior years, where you&#39;ll be taking orgo and/or genetics, both of which are known to be very difficult weed-out classes.\\n\\nThat being said, there are a ton of resources at Cornell to help you, both with pre-med specific issues and non-pre-med specific issues. Other pre-meds are normally pretty open to helping you study or offering to help you figure out something in class. Professors are generally pretty supporting if you reach out to them and go to office hours. There are a lot of opportunities to be had at Cornell outside of class as well, many of which can help your application. Things like research, student organizations, and summer internship opportunities are pretty prevalent among the students.\\n\\nI don&#39;t know much about UCLA, but they do have a good program there, and going there isn&#39;t going to be a huge loss on your application; you can excel and get into medical school whether you choose to go to Cornell or UCLA. At this point in the game, it&#39;s more about visiting the two campuses and figuring out which one fits you the best.&quot;,\n &quot;Generally speaking, if two courses are cross-listed, then they should count towards requirements. However, it&#39;s still a good idea to check with the department, since some departments are more anal about requirements.&quot;,\n &quot;[Here&#39;s what CoE deems as acceptable for transfer credits.](https://www.engineering.cornell.edu/academics/undergraduate/curriculum/handbook/2010/grades_credits.cfm#transfer)\\n\\nI know CAS is a bit more restrictive about transfer credits from CC (I didn&#39;t get any), but I&#39;m not sure about CoE.&quot;,\n &quot;You&#39;ll need loans. I won&#39;t go too far into my financials, but I was in a similar bracket, and I graduated with about 30k debt (though keep in mind that I took 2 summer sessions, which added to my overall burden).&quot;,\n &quot;If a class needs a permission number, then you must get it from the professor. You need to contact the professor teaching the course or that department in order to get the permission number. Some professors and departments won&#39;t give you a permission number unless you give a reason why you want to take the course (e.g. passing a language test for language courses, required for major, taken a pre-req, etc.). Generally speaking, many courses that require a permission number do so because of some sort of limitation or restrictions on enrollment.&quot;,\n &quot;Job-wise, I don&#39;t think it would matter too much. If you intend on going into grad school, it might begin to matter, as some programs have course pre-reqs (though they will also let you attend on a provisional status and make you take the courses you didn&#39;t take, so this is kinda moot).&quot;,\n &#39;Depends on what the form is for and the specific class. Contacting the professor is the best way to get an answer.&#39;,\n &#39;Can confirm. Used to game at computer labs. No regrets. \\n\\nSource: Am also Asian\\n\\nEDIT: But no, seriously, the whole stereotype that Asians are addicted to MOBAs and MMOs/are &quot;amazing l33t gamers&quot; is an annoying one at best and infuriating at worst. Sure, a larger proportion of gamers *might* be Asian, and the best gamers *might* also be Asian, but to paint with such broad strokes is largely damaging to an ethnic group\\&#39;s identity, and to me, is borderline racist. Sure, you aren\\&#39;t calling us chinks or anything, but stereotyping is still negative.&#39;,\n &quot;I took Ancient Greek. It wasn&#39;t that bad. Latin is also pretty mellow too, from what I&#39;ve heard.&quot;,\n &quot;There is no set check-in time for Cornell Days, IIRC. You can just show up any time when the check-in is open. \\n\\nThe best events to go to are probably the ones that interest you the most and show you Cornell&#39;s atmosphere and overall vibe. Check out the libraries, learn about the opportunities that Cornell can provide, maybe sit in on a class to see how the workload is like. Definitely visit Collegetown and the Commons if you can.&quot;,\n &#39;Oceanography is great. &#39;,\n &#39;Don\\&#39;t care about frat hierarchy. It\\&#39;s an arbitrary measurement; a &quot;higher tier&quot; frat doesn\\&#39;t equate to a more enjoyable or memorable experience. It\\&#39;s a far wiser option to join a house where you fit in and where you feel like you belong.\\n\\nNot to mention a lot of the &quot;higher tier&quot; frats do have a history of hazing.&#39;,\n &quot;I&#39;m a lot more aware of my limitations. I&#39;ve learned how to manage my time better. I&#39;ve learned how to deal with failure. I&#39;ve learned how to learn better.\\n\\nI could go on; Cornell has really changed me, due to my experiences and the people I&#39;ve met.&quot;,\n &quot;I don&#39;t really see a point in doing so, as you aren&#39;t going for a degree in the visual or digital arts. I can&#39;t see it hurting you, but I also don&#39;t see it helping your application either.&quot;,\n &quot;Depends on what you&#39;re into. I played video games, hung out with my SO, sometimes got ahead on my classwork, browsed Reddit, hiked around...\\n\\nThere&#39;s a lot of stuff to do in your free time. And you get a surprising amount of it too.&quot;,\n &#39;Many people bring their bikes to Cornell; Ithaca is very bike-friendly. You can store the bike indoors in most dorms (I believe this is the case for the Low Rises). The only time riding a bike would suck would be once the weather gets colder (usually around late October). &#39;,\n &quot;I don&#39;t think they had calzones when I attended. All my friends either ordered theirs from that one calzone place (the name escapes me) or went to Nasties.&quot;,\n &#39;I\\&#39;m going to disagree with your disagreement, because I\\&#39;ve seen plenty of healthy relationships that started in frat parties, including my own. Those that failed ended on fairly amiable terms.\\n\\nIt all boils down to picking wisely, just like any other social venture. Some people just &quot;click&quot; better, some guys are more respectful and tactful, others can be douches. It\\&#39;s just a matter of knowing what you want and not taking compromises on what\\&#39;s the most important to you. \\n\\nFraternities may get a bad rep, but not everyone is like the stereotype. Blanket generalizations are always a poor way to approach anything. \\n\\nI\\&#39;d say go for the frat party. Find someone you like? Get to know them in more sober conditions. Don\\&#39;t find anyone? No big deal. Cornell is a big school, so cast your line elsewhere.&#39;,\n &quot;I didn&#39;t have a job lined up when I graduated. I was unemployed for a year until I got into a Master&#39;s program.&quot;,\n &#39;Fall transfers can rush. Fewer frats participate in fall rush, and the pledge classes tend to be smaller too. I think maybe a dozen or so frats participate in fall rush.&#39;,\n &#39;[Here\\&#39;s the list from fall 2017.](http://www.cornellifc.org/fall-recruitment) It looks like more frats participate in fall rush now than when I was at Cornell. Typically the same frats go back each year for fall.\\n\\nYou can still rush in the spring if you want the more &quot;traditional&quot; rush experience. &#39;,\n &quot;Fall rush is more informal, while spring rush is more formal. When you think of rush, spring rush is what you&#39;re thinking of, not fall. Both are fun times, just different experiences. &quot;,\n &#39;Fraternity rush goes through a formal process, regulated by the IFC and Cornell. Because spring rush is with freshmen, and therefore necessarily involve individuals under the age of 21, rules are much more stringent than in the fall, where people can be over the age of 21.&#39;,\n &quot;I got 7 people I talk to on a regular basis. There are maybe a dozen or more that I talk to maybe once or twice a year. And then I have a fair number of acquaintances. \\n\\nThere are 2 that I go out with every so often. My best friend lives nearby but is in med school so we don&#39;t get to see him that often. One is in the process of applying to med school. Another is in a PhD program in Massachusetts. And one more is doing her PhD in New York.\\n\\nThe seventh one is my fiancee.&quot;,\n &quot;https://cornellconnect.cornell.edu/\\n\\nYou might not get everyone, but it&#39;s a good shot.&quot;,\n &#39;If you are taking a semester off (i.e. you are not registered for classes, the internship is not an approved part of your program, etc.), then you cannot get financial aid from the school, as I understand it. &#39;,\n &#39;If you have them, save those communications and talk with the Housing Director. They may be able to swap you to a different room or swap roommates.\\n\\nThey can\\&#39;t do anything about the lack of AC; that\\&#39;s just a &quot;deal with it&quot; scenario.&#39;,\n &quot;It&#39;s up to each person and their preferences. When I was a student, I tried to space out my classes as best I can because I work best with bursts of activity interspersed throughout the day. Some people find they can handle long periods of lectures and classes, others don&#39;t. A lot of people don&#39;t have a choice because some classes are only offered at certain times.\\n\\nAdd/Drop is a fairly length time-frame, so feel free to test the waters the first week and change accordingly. &quot;,\n &#39;That looks like a fraternity mug. Delta Club might be referring specifically to a fraternity on campus. The one that comes to mind immediately would be Delta Phi (aka Llenroc). Other hints that it might be fraternity-related: the mug of beer, the hands shaking (might be a fraternity symbol), the coat of arms, and &quot;pro una causa&quot;.&#39;,\n &quot;I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re talking about COE courses. These courses have a hard cap imposed on them by the COE instructors/staff. This may be due to limited resources (e.g. tree climbing) or preferred student-instructor ratio (COE prefers lower).\\n\\nGenerally speaking, there is normally a waitlist, and you&#39;re welcome to come to the first class session to see if anyone who is signed up doesn&#39;t show if you&#39;re on it; we&#39;ve filled in a spot that way before for a class. However, after the first class, the course is officially closed.&quot;,\n &#39;You\\&#39;ll have to take a &quot;Historic Breadth&quot; (or something like that) course, but you can avoid classes from the History department entirely.&#39;,\n &quot;You don&#39;t have to take an HA class though. You can avoid it if you take classes in the other 4 categories.&quot;,\n &quot;I&#39;ve had no issues with Lambrou, though he&#39;s gotten both great and bad reviews.&quot;,\n &#39;Would depend on how far you want to be from campus, but my senior year, I had an apartment for $900 a month? One of my friends had an apartment halfway down Buffalo that was I think closer to $600 a month? And the newer ones go for over $1k a month easily.&#39;,\n &quot;Usually the apartment complex has a laundry room. Otherwise, there&#39;s probably still a laundromat nearby?&quot;,\n &#39;*Evening prelims.\\n\\nThere may still be in-class prelims for courses that meet Monday, Wednesday, and/or Friday. Not quite as common, but still a possibility to consider.&#39;,\n &#39;Because hazing is bad? I mean, you don\\&#39;t need to be a genius to know that &quot;mental, sexual, and physical intimidation&quot; isn\\&#39;t exactly rainbows and unicorns.&#39;,\n &#39;You know the saying &quot;Your rights end where my rights begin&quot;? Yeah, that\\&#39;s pretty damn important and relevant here. What you\\&#39;re saying is basically &quot;if I want to do something that harms another person\\&#39;s well-being, I should be allowed to do it&quot;. If you truly believe someone should be able to do that, then you disgust me.\\n\\nHazing isn\\&#39;t just a friendly truth-or-dare, and it isn\\&#39;t something you can brush aside because &quot;everybody is doing it&quot; or by saying &quot;you don\\&#39;t have to do it&quot;. It involves coercion, subterfuge, and takes advantage of the power differential between brothers and pledges. \\n\\nIt isn\\&#39;t as simple as saying &quot;I don\\&#39;t want to do it&quot;. I\\&#39;m guessing you\\&#39;ve never been placed in such a situation before where you felt a societal or group pressure to do something. Imagine being in a bar with friends, and they all challenge you to chug 5 beers in 5 minutes. Or else you\\&#39;ll be ostracized from the group. That\\&#39;s what hazing is. It isn\\&#39;t &quot;do this and if you don\\&#39;t, it\\&#39;s not a big deal&quot;. It\\&#39;s &quot;do this or you\\&#39;ll forever be barred from joining this community&quot;.&#39;,\n &#39;Remembering literally everything is a very poor study approach in both the arts and the sciences. Here\\&#39;s what I did when I took my history courses.\\n\\n1. Find and develop the &quot;big picture&quot;. Each of your readings has a &quot;big picture&quot; they want to convey, particularly secondary sources. Try to find this &quot;big picture&quot; and see how your reading falls underneath this picture. For example, the &quot;big picture&quot; might be to show that the Great Leap Forward was a failure. How does your reading prove (or disprove!) that the Great Leap Forward was a failure?\\n\\n2. Focus on the primary sources. History professors love primary sources over secondary sources because, well, they\\&#39;re contemporary to the period they\\&#39;re studying!\\n\\n3. Summarize the key points of the reading. This can usually be done in a paragraph or two. What message did the author want to convey? What context is your reading from? Are there viewpoints in this reading that particularly stand out? Following our previous example, perhaps your reading focuses on the inconsistencies among the CCP leadership, the poor working conditions, and how callous the CCP leadership was. Expand on those points with 3 to 5 sentences from the author\\&#39;s perspective.\\n\\n4. How are your readings linked? That is, do they conflict with each other? Do they form a timeline? Are they a mix of primary and secondary sources? Are they from opposing sides of history? Since history is told from the eyes of the storyteller, it\\&#39;s really important to keep in mind how these readings relate to each other and the broader historical timeframe. \\n\\nMy recommendation is for every reading to summarize it in a paragraph or two. Depending on what your course is specifically about, perhaps write down one or two sentences that describe how each reading relates to that week\\&#39;s learning goals or the course in general. You often don\\&#39;t need to read the entire thing to get the general picture. It may be helpful to bring in a handful of specific examples from your readings to support your position or expand your understanding.\\n\\nAnd as always, reach out to your professor to see if they have anything they want you to specifically look for in your readings!&#39;,\n &#39;About as hard as it is to get bids as a second-semester freshman. \\n\\nSpeaking specifically for frats, part of it also depends on how much longer you have a Cornell. Like a sophomore has a better shot than a junior, just because you have 2 additional semesters to contribute to the fraternity.\\n\\nNo clue if sororities take that into considerations or not.&#39;,\n &quot;Fraternity rush is fine as a solo person. When I did rush, I went in solo and found a house that fit me. \\n\\nAgain, not sure on sorority rush but I&#39;m pretty sure you can go in solo and find a house that fits.&quot;,\n &#39;The process was fun, and I got into a house that I really connected with. My pledge class and brothers are still some of my best friends; most of my pledge class came to my wedding a few months back and it was like no time had passed from graduating. \\n\\nBest place to begin is just to start going from house to house. A ton of houses have their rush week schedule planned out ahead of time and will have them advertised on their websites or on quartercards during rush week. So if you connect with the brothers and like their schedule, keep going to their events. Just don\\&#39;t do suicide rush, where you only rush one or two houses. Better to &quot;shop around&quot;.&#39;,\n &quot;I didn&#39;t know any brothers in any of the frats I rushed, and I still meshed very well with the frat I joined, so knowing people isn&#39;t a requirement at all. &quot;,\n &#39;Eh, not really. From the recruitment side of things, groups are looked on more favorably because we assume if we get one person hooked, we can use them to get their friends hooked, but in terms of who we focus on, everyone gets equal attention (unless they show no interest, obviously). Being in a group gives you no more of an advantage than being solo. \\n\\nThis obviously varies depending on specific house, but generally, they look at individual fit as much as they do with group fit for their prospective PC.&#39;]"

BILL NYE THE PARTY GUY.         Memes aside, I honestly don&#39;t know a good answer to your question. On the one hand, the party scene in Ithaca seems to be completely dead during breaks (I stayed for Fall break this year and there was nothing except a few private, invite only mixers), but on the other hand, I feel like there would be at least a few parties on NYE just because it&#39;s such a popular party night and there&#39;s still a decent amount of people that stay at cornell for the winter. Just ask as many friends as you can and see what&#39;s going on. I feel like you should be able to find something low-key at least. \n\nSpeaker: Dr_Narwhal, Conversation: 6h08sg, Surprise: 0.586453948139138\nFall 2011 Admissions Stats:\n\nSchool | Apps | Admits | Rate\n---|---|----|----\nHumEc | 1,372 | 439 | 32.00%\nHotel | 759 | 207 | 27.27%\nILR | 1,059 | 254 | 23.98%\nCOE | 8,696 | 1,787 | 20.55%\nCALS | 5,309 | 1,034 | 19.48%\nAAP | 1,099 | 176 | 16.01%\nCAS | 17,057 | 2,641 | 15.48%\n**Total**^â€  | **36,387** | **6,538** | **17.97%**\n\n^(â€  includes 1,036 applicants who did not specify a college and thus were not accepted)\n\nThe rates may have changed since 2011, but this is probably a decent approximation of what the current acceptance rates look like.\n\n[Source (with further breakdown by gender)](https://dpb.cornell.edu/documents/1000003.pdf)\n\nEdit: ignore this.

[This article](http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/cornell?a=d&amp;amp;d=CDS19200115.2.23#) from 1920 is from when Ithaca went dry due to national legislation, so I would guess that there weren&#39;t any local ordinances. And 1940 age limit wouldn&#39;t have been much of a factor, as it was 18 and would have likely been moderately enforced. My guess would be liquor licensing issues or unlicensed production/sale. 1933 in NY based on wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._history_of_alcohol_minimum_purchase_age_by_state\n\nand this NYT article http://www.nytimes.com/1984/05/28/nyregion/issue-and-debate-raising-new-york-drinking-age-to-21.html\n\nSpeaker: t3hasiangod, Conversation: 4w8d7e, Surprise: 1.0471125026178563\nEh, I would be hesitant to wear those. From the photo, it doesn&#39;t look like they have good ankle support, which is pretty key in slippery terrain. They don&#39;t look like the winter-type of boots, but like the boots you wear on a sunny day. I&#39;d recommend looking around sporting shops like REI or Eastern Mountain Sports for their boots. You&#39;ll find a lot of hiking shoes and boots (men and women) that are waterproof, provide good ankle support, and offer great traction in the snow.

It&#39;s not just local weather: outbound cancellations are often because the incoming flight couldn&#39;t get out of its prior location, or the destination is socked in by weather.\n\n"
