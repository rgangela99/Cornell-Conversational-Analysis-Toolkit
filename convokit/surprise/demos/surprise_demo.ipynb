    "Computing Surprise With ConvoKit\n",
    "=====================\n",
    "This notebook provides a demo of how to use the Surprise transformer to compute surprise across a corpus. The transformer currently only allows computation of how surprising a speaker's utterances in one conversation (target) are compared to their utterances in all other conversations (context) in the corpus. Eventually, the functionality of the Surprise transformer will be abstracted to allow for computation of surprise between any target and context types."

From the photo, it doesn't look like they have good ankle support, which is pretty key in slippery terrain. They don't look like the winter-type of boots, but like the boots you wear on a sunny day. I'd recommend looking around sporting shops like REI or Eastern Mountain Sports for their boots.

Hopefully, you'll really enjoy becoming a Balchie. \n\nSpeaker: t3hasiangod, Conversation: 5hlpq0, Surprise: 9.871736342572245\nYou cannot move out of West halfway through the academic year without paying a fine for breaking your contract. This is assuming that they will let you break your contract too; Housing is pretty strict on that.\n\nMost apartment goers do research over the summer, but landlords cannot actually give tours or sign new leases until 60 days after a lease begins. Leases in Collegetown typically begin either in early June or late August, meaning the big push for signing leases begins in mid August and again in early November. Many people will look at apartments during Orientation week or in the weeks following up to the second big lease signing push. Many companies offer at least some pictures and floor plans online as well. Not being here in the summer is not a disadvantage; many domestic students also aren't here over the majority of the summer and still find apartments.\n\nSpeaker: cornell256, Conversation: 7gd8vb, Surprise: 9.64534099425031\nThe physical location and environment - Ithaca is amazing and truly an incredibly beautiful place. Ivy league education at a large-ish school with more overall diversity than most schools of this caliber. Historically excellent hockey team, currently one of the best in the country. Best engineering program in the Ivy League/one of the best engineering programs on the east coast. Top quality food for a university. Physical Education department with amazing resources and opportunities, better than any I've ever seen. Other than that, academic, research, and future work opportunities in MechE will be similar to those of other top engineering schools like MIT, CMU, Stanford, etc, so they definitely exist elsewhere.\n\nSpeaker: mushiettake, Conversation: 6mbiyo, Surprise: 9.583125848034605\nThere have been other threads in this sub talking about math options, especially 2230. I can't really speak from personal experience on these classes though. In general, the engineering math classes (2940 in this case) tend to be more application and problem solving rather than proofs compared to the arts equivalent. I personally would never take a nighttime class, but to each their own. \n\nAs for discussion sections, student center will probably require you to sign up for them. Depending on the subject, they could range quite a bit. Some might have mandatory quizzes or assignments due at the beginning or participation points or presentations. Some may include extra lecture content while others will be seminar style or group activities and problem solving or having practice examples worked out. Others may just serve as an extra optional office hours. \n\nSpeaker: EQUASHNZRKUL, Conversation: 91yv8u, Surprise: 9.508734725382855\nO-Week: Everyone here is so nice and I want to be friends with all of them!\n\nFinals Week: Fuck everybody, they’re all cunts and make the library too loud and its too cold in my dorm and everyone I like is ignoring me and having fun while I rot at this desk doing 500 math problems a day. Fuck me, why didn’t I pay attention in lecture I hate myself. Fuck the professor, his boring-ass class, and his stupid mustache. I’m gonna burn this place to the ground! Just don’t go on the meme page. Just don’t go on facebook. Its quite literally acts like a cancer on society Its mostly deflecting, insecure Brown and Dartmouth students and cunty Harvard students who think their CS program holds a modicum of respect\n\nSpeaker: t3hasiangod, Conversation: 4fwz3i, Surprise: 9.501636243179242\nWell, you don't get to choose which dorm you live in, unless you want to join a program house. Freshman dorms fall under two broad categories: suite style and traditional style.\n\nSuite style dorms are made up of suites, or pods, which usually consist of 2 doubles and either 1 or 2 singles. This suite shares a bathroom, and is single sex, though the dorm is co-ed. Suite style dorms include the High Rises (HR5 and Jameson), the Low Rises (LR6, LR7, JAM, HILC, Ujamma), CKB, Mews, and the Townhouses. \n\nTraditional style dorms consist of rooms along a hallway, with all members of that hallway sharing a bathroom. Generally, the hallways/sections are single sex. Traditional style dorms consist of Dickson, Donlon, and Balch (all-girls).\n\nThe program houses are tailored to specific interests. You need to apply to each program houses explaining why you think you would fit into their atmosphere, and what you would contribute to that atmosphere. The program houses are Just About Music (music), Ujamma (African culture), Akwe:kon (Native American culture), Risley (performing and visual arts), HILC (international culture), and Eco House (eco-friendly).\n\nThe main North Campus gym is Helen Newman, and physically, CKB is the closest. However, all North Campus dorms are within a few minutes walk. There is also a smaller gym in Appel. Physically, Mews is closest, but again, it's within walking distance for all freshman dorms.\n\nCKB and Mews are singles and doubles only, and have central AC. Low Rises and High Rises have singles, doubles, and triples. Donlon is the only dorm with quads. Balch is females only, and some rooms share a sink room. Other than that, there is little difference between each dorm.\n\nSpeaker: t3hasiangod, Conversation: 5ifb7k, Surprise: 9.482750301730915\nCo-ops and frats have some significant differences, with a few similarities. I had a few friends in co-ops, so I'm somewhat familiar with them. I was part of a frat, so I'm far more comfortable talking about Greek life. Here's a quick rundown on both of them.\n\nCo-ops:\n\n* Typically smaller, ranging from 10 to 30-ish people in a house\n* Application process, which can be pretty selective for some co-ops\n* Members democratically vote on house rules and jobs\n* Some are co-ed, while others are single-sex\n* Not governed by an overarching university body (mostly...they still need to abide by Cornell Code of Conduct as they are university-owned)\n* Not a part of a larger national organization\n* Price can vary, but are typically some of the lowest options for housing\n\nFrats:\n\n* Sizes can vary greatly, with the smaller frats having around 20 members and the larger frats having close to four to five times that number\n* Join via rush week versus an application/interview process\n* Brothers have to pay dues to their national organizations, as well as house fees for room and board, social fees, etc., but living in many frats can be cheaper than living on campus\n* Brothers may or may not have house rules and jobs, depending on the frat. These rules and jobs may not necessarily be voted upon by the brotherhood. If you live in, expect to play host to parties and events into the wee hours of the morning.\n* Governed by the IFC, and as such, each fraternity is required to abide by any rules and regulations set by the IFC and OFSIL\n* Each chapter is part of a larger national organization, and each chapter is required to abide by the bylaws set forth by the national organization\n* Each chapter house might not be university-owned (this actually plays significance when dealing with police and infractions of Cornell rules)\n\nFrom what I know/heard, it's easier to get into a frat than it is to get into a co-op, though I'm obviously biased; IMO, any person can find a frat that fits them, as long as they look hard enough. That being said, everybody I know who was part of a co-op found it to be very enjoyable and formed close relationships with their housemates. And having dealt with fraternity life, the relatively greater freedom of a co-op might be better for some types of people than others. \n\n"

Later on, many easily took at least 18 credits per semester, even though they came in with additional AP credits.

BILL NYE THE PARTY GUY.         Memes aside, I honestly don't know a good answer to your question. On the one hand, the party scene in Ithaca seems to be completely dead during breaks (I stayed for Fall break this year and there was nothing except a few private, invite only mixers), but on the other hand, I feel like there would be at least a few parties on NYE just because it's such a popular party night and there's still a decent amount of people that stay at cornell for the winter. Just ask as many friends as you can and see what's going on. I feel like you should be able to find something low-key at least. \n\nSpeaker: Dr_Narwhal, Conversation: 6h08sg, Surprise: 3.0052505436278096\nFall 2011 Admissions Stats:\n\nSchool | Apps | Admits | Rate\n---|---|----|----\nHumEc | 1,372 | 439 | 32.00%\nHotel | 759 | 207 | 27.27%\nILR | 1,059 | 254 | 23.98%\nCOE | 8,696 | 1,787 | 20.55%\nCALS | 5,309 | 1,034 | 19.48%\nAAP | 1,099 | 176 | 16.01%\nCAS | 17,057 | 2,641 | 15.48%\n**Total**^† | **36,387** | **6,538** | **17.97%**\n\n^(† includes 1,036 applicants who did not specify a college and thus were not accepted)\n\nThe rates may have changed since 2011, but this is probably a decent approximation of what the current acceptance rates look like.\n\n[Source (with further breakdown by gender)](https://dpb.cornell.edu/documents/1000003.pdf)\n\nEdit: ignore this.

That's not a good thing\n\nI don't know if I would prefer Gucci or Young Thug. Can't we get somebody like Big KRIT?\n\nEDIT: \n\n&gt;On March 22, 2013, the Atlanta Police Department issued a warrant for the arrest of Mane, after he allegedly attacked a fan who was trying to take a photo with him. A soldier, named James, claimed that Mane hit him with a bottle in the head, while he was talking to a security guard about getting a photo with the rapper. He was treated at Grady Memorial Hospital and received 10 stitches.[85] Four days later, a second man going by the initials T.J., claimed Gucci punched him in the face, when T.J. tried to shake his hand after a concert performance at Club Onyx in Philadelphia.[86] \n\nWhy are we getting this guy?\n\nSpeaker: agottler, Conversation: 9iyo8u, Surprise: 4.184621115900301\nsome ideas based off of my personal experience: \n\nbooze \n\ntissues \n\ncondoms (both sexes)\n\ncaffeine (mio energy is good shit, some red bull’s, or 5 hour energy whatever they prefer)\n\nalcohol \n\nemergen-c packets (flu szn)\n\ngum (5 cobalt is my go-to)\n\nask them if they need toiletries (people run out of razor blades and shaving cream pretty quick and girls could always use tampons/pads/medicine because the period always comes (hopefully lol) \n \nif they eat sweets, candy. if they’re a gym rate maybe some preworkout or protein samples from the gnc or a pack of cliff bars \n\nthe liquid product of fermentation \n\nsome meds - (melatonin, dayquil and nyquil and excedrin migraine) \n\nif they have an iphone, a cord \n\nthe devils nectar \n\nSpeaker: turtlecrk, Conversation: 4owh99, Surprise: 4.2655297317969\nHere is some actual data on incoming flights, for the period Apr 2013 to Apr 2016 (from http://www.transtats.bts.gov/ot_delay/ot_delaycause1.asp\n\nBinghamton 1,112 flights, 81.35% on time, 1.47% canceled/diverted\n\nElmira/Corning 4,820 flights, 77.85% on time, 2.38% cancel/divert\n\nIthaca/Cortland 846 flights, 81.5% on time, 2.12% cancel/divert\n\nSyracuse 16,205 flights, 75.27% on time, 3.01% cancel/divert\n\nThe numbers are much less than actual flight counts, so there may be selection bias.\n\nMy experience is that most delays and cancellations happen in winter (not surprising).  It's not just local weather: outbound cancellations are often because the incoming flight couldn't get out of its prior location, or the destination is socked in by weather.\n\nSpeaker: Sleeppppp, Conversation: 7jz1e0, Surprise: 4.428427358749921\nCould you give more information about yourself and your level of experiences?\nGeneral advice would be: make sure you are proficient in Java/Github/OOP etc. I feel like the hardest part in 2112 is not a certain concept/data structure, but rather how to design your project, how to cooperate with your partner and keep coding till the end of the world.\nI would suggest  building some simple projects from scratch. This will improve your coding skills significantly! Hi, your experiences sound fine to me! \nI definitely recommend CS 61B. I've looked at its notes but not projects. The notes are in-depth and well-organized.\nDon't worry about learning the material twice. Data structure is arguably the most fundamental/ important material in CS. You will thank youself during recruiting season later btw, you can see the syallbus on course website. Just google CS 2112 2017 Fall\n\nSpeaker: Bearclawmen, Conversation: 91yv8u, Surprise: 4.470326996528452\nI don't understand why you're downvoting. You all pay too much a semester to not be vocal about the bad dining situation. Cornell just unveiled plans to make huge dormitories on North with presumably more dining halls but still can't fix the lack of dining in central campus. Okenshields is bad. Unless you go there for salad or off brand cereal their menu is unpalatable. Likewise, every time I step into a north campus dining hall I see a bunch of tablecards talking about eating healthy blah blah blah but they seem to serve pre-cooked fries every day. Yall should care more about this million dollar business that isn't up to expectation. If we are #3 in the nation for food it should reflect that. I hate how some buildings look. I like the only/new mix but some buildings don't fit the ivy-league-techy vibe: Namely Statler, most of the old engineering quad,uris, etc. I really like the style between rockefeller, baker and sage. \n\nSpeaker: Weinfield, Conversation: 90nmvb, Surprise: 4.623737985396856\nMy SHP waiver app got denied, after being approved 3 years in a row... Apparently my plan is not a participating provider with Cayuga medical center (http://cayugamed.org/PFYCinsurance.cfm) and https://studenthealthbenefits.cornell.edu/requirements. (new req or cayuga dropped my provder?)\n\nThe specific reason was \"Your plan is not a participating provider with Cayuga Medical Center. Please provide documentation that validates your plan offers Out of Network reimbursement rates of at least 70% of U.S. based \"reasonable and customary\" charges. (1003)\"\n\nAnyone get anything similar and if they were able to resolve? It sounds like it's OK if my plan is not a participating provider with Cayuga, as long as I provide evidence of the last statement? Would rather not pay an extra 2-3k for SHP. \n\n"
