After graduating high school I went abroad for college, and I\\'d visit my family on short-term passes most summer/winter breaks.\\n\\nSo I spent a few weeks back in Singapore this summer before going to Hong Kong to visit a friend for a week. After that I came back here since school doesn\\'t start until later this month. When I got to immigration the lady was immediately unfriendly, but I\\'ve encountered my fair share of unfriendly airport agents and everything usually turned out fine.\\n\\nShe asked me the same sorta questions I usually got, but any time I misunderstood a question or she couldn\\'t hear me or something she\\'d raise her voice or give me a rude response. I hadn\\'t even done anything but she seemed generally pissed for whatever reason. Since it was like 2am and I was tired, I tried to be polite so I could move on and get home as soon as possible.\\n\\nI took out my phone to check the time, and when I turned it off it made a click sound (just like all iPhones do), and when the lady heard it her demeanor suddenly flipped. She accused me of taking a photo (even though I didn\\'t) and demanded I delete it. I showed her the Photo app on my phone so she could see there wasn\\'t a photo of her, then she just grabbed my phone and went through it herself. When she gave it back I even showed her how the click was just from the phone turning off, but she completely ignored me.\\n\\nFrom there her behavior just got so much worse, and her questions more accusatory. She noticed I was just in Singapore last week and asked what I was doing back so soon. I told her it was because my family lives here. I even had a return ticket for when I go back to school. She told me I needed to go to the office to get a secondary inspection (aka I was being detained). She didn\\'t move and I didn\\'t know where to go so I asked if I should follow her, and she yelled back \"How else are you supposed to get there if you don\\'t follow me?\"\\n\\nThen when we were passing by all the other travelers waiting in line at immigration, she yelled out \"If you go traveling, don\\'t throw tantrums\" for everyone to hear. I don\\'t get why she had to humiliate me like that. By \"tantrums\" I assume she was referring to the imaginary photo I took of her so that I could later shame her on social media or whatever.\\n\\nAnyway, she took me to another counter. I was getting pretty nervous so I started tapping my fingers against the counter, and the male agent gave me a hard look and in a harsh tone he told me to stop. At this point I was worried all the agents would treat me like some sort of suspicious criminal, but thankfully the actual agents that did my secondary inspection were much more polite. They asked me some questions, then asked for my mom\\'s EP details and phone number so that they can contact her to confirm the answers I gave them (our address, my status as a student, even the fact that she was my mom, etc). They took me to a waiting room while they called my mom, and eventually they came back in and told me I was free to go with a 30-day pass. I asked them if I was in any trouble. They told me I wasn\\'t and that this was just normal immigration protocol, even though nothing about it felt remotely normal.\\n\\nAfter the whole experience I just felt really dehumanized. I used to think of Singapore as my home but now it feels like I\\'m not even allowed here. I\\'m Filipino, which I know is kind of a red flag but I figured since I used to live here and even have family living here that I wouldn\\'t have any issues.\\n\\nI still plan on visiting my family in the future (likely twice a year), but I\\'m worried about this whole situation affecting my travel plans. Will I be flagged as a suspicious person whenever I come back? I\\'m wondering if the immigration agent could\\'ve even flagged me as \"difficult\" or \"insubordinate\" or something.

I get pretty awesome teaching reviews because I take my job seriously and am good at it. But every once in a while some student thinks they know what's best and tries to tell me how to teach. Those are the comments I dismiss.\\n\\nGenerally, the student does not know what's best for the course. My job is to teach about cultural diversity. We can discuss current events, but we need to do so by critically addressing texts written by actual social scientists. Not news articles. And complaints about the reading are usually just that: complaints.\\n\\nI love the tendency for trolls on here to simply jump to the worst possible assumption about someone without any information.

You fail to carefully read what I have said multiple times, and are choosing to extrapolate ridiculous things with no evidence. So, let me break this down for you, step by step, since you would rather launch into a tirade and then complain childlishly about not being taken seriously.\\n\\nNote that I pointed out that many of the comments I receive are irrelevant. For example, one of the comments I got on a recent evaluation told me that I should cut out a unit on environmental issues. That literally is not even an option, so it is impossible to take that student's feedback into account. The student simply did not like the unit or did not see it as directly applicable. That is the student's problem, not mine, for failing to see the importance of that course material.\\n\\nKeep in mind as well that this was ONE STUDENT. And when you get comments like that all the time, that have nothing to do with each other, it adds up.\\n\\nNow, most students don't even leave comments, or when they do leave comments, it's generally positive. So when I say 70%, I actually mean 70% of students who attempt to leave suggestions. Sadly, those suggestions are almost always poorly thought out, self-centered, or do not account for bureaucratic information the student couldn't know.\\n\\nAnd finally, of course, most students leaving these types of comments are not actually open minded citizens engaging in the learning process, but they see my teaching as a service and choose to approach talking to me with the same kind of disdain you have shown. That doesn't fly in the professional world.\\n\\nSo THAT is why I say I dismiss most of the suggestions I get outright. And to be honest, until my teaching scores dip below a 4.7/5 average (I get almost entirely 5's and some 4's every semester with over 90% response rates) I am going to keep ignoring those outliers.\\n\\nSorry if that offends you, little snowflake. What I would suggest is that you tone down your savior complex, keyboard warrior, and learn how to provide better feedback. Or step back and consider the real purpose and value of your education, not just your short-term satisfaction.\"],\n",

My mother knew she wanted me the second she found out she was pregnant, but I was a one night stand baby and my father wanted nothing to do with me. She had me and has had to deal with the consequences pretty much ever since. My extended family shunned her for having a child outside of marriage. She was treated like a cat in heat by my grandparents because they thought she lacked the sense to not get pregnant again. And she never found someone to be my father because in the Christian community she was essentially tainted goods.\\n\\nI know being born wasn't my fault. I didn't choose to exist. But I wish that my mom could have lived the life she wanted and not the life she was forced to. She has never expressed resentment toward me because I know she doesn't regret her decision. But honestly I sometimes regret it for her. \",\n",

Why would God care so much if you're born out of wedlock? It reminds me of the idea that Muslim men are supposed to have beards...I just don't understand why God would care so much about a guy having a beard. Seems more like some kind of tribalistic, primate thing, to be honest (no offense to Muslims, that's just my atheistic take on it).\\n\\nSo, what makes Christianity really different from other religions? How do we know it's really a divine revelation from a higher dimension and not just something thought up by guys down here? Thanks.

It’s called ‘Street Epistemology’. People film conversations in which they feel they have defeated and humiliated a believer, put them on youtube, and others watch and try it out, thrilled by the idea of using the method to make others look or feel foolish. \\n\\nAt best, a Socratic method is a great, incisive way of cutting away problematic thinking and getting to the heart of the truth. It has integrity and it’s useful. That is not what’s going on here. These folks are not above pretending to be Christians to trick people here into engaging. They’re not above using their ‘method’ on those who are openly in crisis and are here seeking support. A quick glance at a questioner’s post history will often tell you everything you need to know.\\n\\nA couple of points that could be helpful:\\n\\n- Faith is one of those things that is understood and experienced from within. It isn’t an of-this-world thing, so it can’t be persuasively expressed as an of-this-world answer to an of-this-world question (Why do you believe? What evidence do you have? Why your God and not some other? Etc etc.) That’s okay. The reason it’s difficult to give a persuasive answer is because it’s an irrelevant question.\\n\\n- This sub, and others like it, is actually composed of back-to-back explanations and explorations of our multi-faceted faith, how it works and how we justify it. If a questioner seems hurt by your unwillingness to engage directly, you can invite them just to look around, read and learn. If they’re genuine they will be pleased and interested to do so.\\n\\n- A lived relationship with God is a complex, nuanced, ever-growing, ever-developing thing. That makes it hard to sum up in a persuasive and pithy nutshell. That is the strength and complexity of your faith, not its weakness.\\n\\n- You’re not letting God or your fellow Christian down by preferring not to engage, when to engage would be to encourage someone in a hobby aimed at humiliating other people. It is actually not a pastime any decent person should support.',\n",

       "                           'Mark 13:32, RS: “Of that day or that hour no ones knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” (Of course, that would not be the case if Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were coequal, comprising one Godhead. And if, as some suggest, the Son was limited by his human nature from knowing, the question remains, Why did the Holy Spirit not know?)\\n\\nMatt. 20:20-23, RS: “The mother of the sons of Zebedee .\\xa0.\\xa0. said to him [Jesus], ‘Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.’ But Jesus answered, .\\xa0.\\xa0. ‘You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father.’” (How strange, if, as claimed, Jesus is God! Was Jesus here merely answering according to his “human nature”? If, as Trinitarians say, Jesus was truly “God-man”—both God and man, not one or the other—would it truly be consistent to resort to such an explanation? Does not Matthew 20:23 rather show that the Son is not equal to the Father, that the Father has reserved some prerogatives for himself?)\\n\\nMatt. 12:31,\\xa032, RS: “Every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. And whoever says a word against the Son of man will be forgiven; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.” (If the Holy Spirit were a person and were God, this text would flatly contradict the Trinity doctrine, because it would mean that in some way the Holy Spirit was greater than the Son. Instead, what Jesus said shows that the Father, to whom the “Spirit” belonged, is greater than Jesus, the Son of man.)\\nJohn 14:28, RS: “[Jesus said:] If you loved me, you would have rejoiced, because I go to the Father; for the Father is greater than I.”\\n\\n1 Cor. 11:3, RS: “I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a woman is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.” (Clearly, then, Christ is not God, and God is of superior rank to Christ. It should be noted that this was written about 55\\xa0C.E., some 22 years after Jesus returned to heaven. So the truth here stated applies to the relationship between God and Christ in heaven.)\\n1 Cor. 15:27,\\xa028 RS: “‘God has put all things in subjection under his [Jesus’] feet.’ But when it says, ‘All things are put in subjection under him,’ it is plain that he is excepted who put all things under him. When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things under him, that God may be everything to every one.”\\n\\nThe Hebrew word Shad·dai′ and the Greek word Pan·to·kra′tor are both translated “Almighty.” Both original-language words are repeatedly applied to Jehovah, the Father. (Ex. 6:3; Rev. 19:6) Neither expression is ever applied to either the Son or the holy spirit.\\n',\n",
       "                           'John 1:1,\\xa02:  RS reads: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.” (KJ, Dy, JB, NAB use similar wording.) However, NW reads: “In the beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god. This one was in the beginning with God.”\\n\\nWhich translation of John 1:1,\\xa02 agrees with the context? John 1:18 says: “No one has ever seen God.” Verse 14 clearly says that “the Word became flesh and dwelt among us .\\xa0.\\xa0. we have beheld his glory.” Also, verses 1,\\xa02 say that in the beginning he was “with God.” Can one be with someone and at the same time be that person? At John 17:3, Jesus addresses the Father as “the only true God”; so, Jesus as “a god” merely reflects his Father’s divine qualities.—Heb. 1:3.\\n\\nIs the rendering “a god” consistent with the rules of Greek grammar? Some reference books argue strongly that the Greek text must be translated, “The Word was God.” But not all agree. In his article “Qualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns: Mark 15:39 and John 1:1,” Philip B. Harner said that such clauses as the one in John 1:1, “with an anarthrous predicate preceding the verb, are primarily qualitative in meaning. They indicate that the logos has the nature of theos.” He suggests: “Perhaps the clause could be translated, ‘the Word had the same nature as God.’” (Journal of Biblical Literature, 1973, pp. 85, 87) Thus, in this text, the fact that the word the·os′ in its second occurrence is without the definite article (ho) and is placed before the verb in the sentence in Greek is significant. Interestingly, translators that insist on rendering John 1:1, “The Word was God,” do not hesitate to use the indefinite article (a, an) in their rendering of other passages where a singular anarthrous predicate noun occurs before the verb. Thus at John 6:70, JB and KJ both refer to Judas Iscariot as “a devil,” and at John 9:17 they describe Jesus as “a prophet.”\\n\\nJohn J. McKenzie, S.J., in his Dictionary of the Bible, says: “Jn 1:1 should rigorously be translated ‘the word was with the God [= the Father], and the word was a divine being.’”—(Brackets are his. Published with nihil obstat and imprimatur.) (New York, 1965), p. 317.\\n\\nIn harmony with the above, AT reads: “the Word was divine”; Mo, “the Logos was divine”; NTIV, “the word was a god.” In his German translation Ludwig Thimme expresses it in this way: “God of a sort the Word was.” Referring to the Word (who became Jesus Christ) as “a god” is consistent with the use of that term in the rest of the Scriptures. For example, at Psalm 82:1-6 human judges in Israel were referred to as “gods” (Hebrew, ’elo·him′; Greek, the·oi′, at John 10:34) because they were representatives of Jehovah and were to speak his law\\n\\nThe New Catholic Encyclopedia states: “The formulation ‘one God in three Persons’ was not solidly established, certainly not fully assimilated into Christian life and its profession of faith, prior to the end of the 4th century. But it is precisely this formulation that has first claim to the title the Trinitarian dogma. Among the Apostolic Fathers, there had been nothing even remotely approaching such a mentality or perspective.”—(1967), Vol. XIV, p. 299.\\n\\nIn The Encyclopedia Americana we read: “Christianity derived from Judaism and Judaism was strictly Unitarian [believing that God is one person]. The road which led from Jerusalem to Nicea was scarcely a straight one. Fourth century Trinitarianism did not reflect accurately early Christian teaching regarding the nature of God; it was, on\\xa0the contrary, a deviation from this teaching.”—(1956), Vol.\\xa0XXVII, p. 294L.\\n'],\n",

Crony capitalism (caused by government involvement in private industry) has increased these costs. \\n\\nAdditionally, I don't like the idea of having a government system deny me care one day and then leave me to die, since I wouldn't have a choice to be in the government system.

I\\'m not trying to scare you, but there are a lot of extra attacks, mechanics and phases which become much, *much* more dangerous if they\\'re not handled appropriately (and scale to various levels of lethality with certain mistlock instabilities -- 3 of which are active at T4).  If you play a Thief/Elementalist pretty much everything can kill you, for example. \\n\\nI\\'d strongly recommend doing the daily recommended Fractals (eg; 69, 36, 25, today) for **Large** Fractal Potion sets.  [They\\'re very powerful offensive and defensive buffs.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractal_Potion) and if you\\'re playing or aspiring to play in more difficult tiers then you need to respect the content until you master it.  15% damage reduction, 15 % extra damage and 50% endurance regeneration are powerful modifiers that make gameplay much smoother.  \\n\\n1.  Boss HP scaling; -- You can\\'t get away with running mediocre builds and lackluster DPS rotations or you\\'ll hit enrage times or have to wipe/reset multiple times before you\\'re able to get a kill.   \\n2.  Innate \"Threat\"; -- Mobs basically have all their defining characteristics turned up a notch in T3/T4. \\n3.  Animations; -- You need to be able to recognize which animations and environmental textures are dangerous. \\n4.  Mechanics; -- You want a solid understanding of every Fractal in-detail to minimize difficulty with minimal support. \\n5.  Gear/AR are the bare minimum for entry into T3 &amp; T4 Fractals.  Always take large Fractal Mobility/Defense/Offense pots. \\n\\nWhether it\\'s slams, mass AoE\\'s, shockwaves, conditions, dazes or interrupts -- there\\'s much more pressure on players.  There\\'s a reason why most T4 Fractal pugs try to bring along a Druid/Chrono, and it\\'s because of QoL (quality of life) improvements.  There\\'s also a big difference between running with a good and a bad support player -- objectively speaking.  Fractal Instabilities like afflicted, adrenaline rush, toxic trails or vindicators can be really difficult to acclimate to without solid foundations. \\n\\nLast week I played DPS for the T4 Swamplands Fractal (I usually play Druid/Chrono/Rev support).  Our LFG picked up a Chrono that was new to T4\\'s but told us not to worry because he had done them with his guild before.  Within about 5 minutes he had full died and been revived 2-3 times.  He eventually left saying, \"This is stupid.\"  I believe it was toxic trails / add phases / that screwed him.  He just couldn\\'t kite mobs properly and took all sorts of extra, unnecessary damage.

This means that we wont know the exact form the geodesics will take. \\n\\nBut we can make solid guesses and do numerical calculations. The best source for these considerations I have found is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1010.5260). However, this review focuses mainly on the gravitational waves produced by these mergers. It does, however, consider your final question in one of the last sections. In general, the amount of electromagnetic radiation given off will depend on the size of the hole and the presence of an accretion disk or other matter between the holes. Also, this radiation is expected to arrive at the same time as the gravitational waves since they both travel at the speed of light. Any deviation from this would be evidence for some speculative physics theories like de Sitter Relativity or Causal Dynamical Triangulation. Also, keep in mind that since light always travels the same speed it will not be \"accelerated\" like you mentioned. It can experience red- or blueshift though.\\n\\nAlso, we can make some good guesses about the geodesics, and the paths of light, that occur in this system. There will not be any (observable) figure 8s since if it is meaningful to say they occur it would be within the event horizons of the merging black holes EDIT: this is not true, I don\\'t know if there would be any stable photon orbits and what they would look like. Also, a lot would depend on the size of the holes since for supermassive black holes the local curvature outside the event horizon is extremely close to flat. This means that if not for the presence of other matter you would not experience any trauma from being between the two edges of the event horizons, no matter how close they were, and you wouldn’t necessarily see any extreme optical phenomena when you look away from the holes. But from other perspectives or smaller black holes, there would probably be some very weird and extreme gravitational lensing. Light sources behind a single black hole will appear from a distance as an [Einstein Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_ring). But from behind the merging black holes, they might make an [Einstein Cross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_Cross) or even something weirder since the distribution of matter is elongated but in a more interesting way.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Do you happend to know how long the average satellite today would stay in orbit once it isn't maintained anymore? I'm curious.\\n\\n&gt;You would expect to find various metallic relics on Earth.\\n\\nLike what exactly and for how long?\\n\\n&gt;You would expect to find many exploited resources underground.\\n\\nMines collapse and disappear. You wouldn't know about the missing recources if you don't know they were there in the first place.\\n\\n&gt;A rapid change in CO2 levels in the past would be easy to find.\\n\\nYes, and if you look at the record we do find those too, but they can be explained through other natural processes as well. \\n\\nI'm not arguing for OPs ancient advanced civilization btw, but I think it's impossible to disprove it. Just like it's impossible to really disprove anything. I don't really see any reason to believe that there ever was such a civilization of course, because there isn't any proper evidence for it. \",\n",
       "                           '&gt; Our geostationary satellites are expected to stay in orbit for millions of years at least. Not in a perfect geostationary orbit but still in an orbit.\\n\\nCould you provide a source for that? I was of the opinion that they\\'d still be affected by ever so slight atmospheric drag. Impact with dust/debris/meteoroids might slow them down and push them off their orbit further over centuries. Wikipedia further says this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit#Orbital_stability\\n\\n&gt;Everything, for a very long time (just gets harder to find over time). Remains of buildings, cars, tools, ... we would (will?) leave behind a geological layer of processed metals in many places.\\n\\nYes, we are doing that now. Plastics for example last for a long time. Simple metal structures not so much. But things can fossilize and would then survive in the geological record for millions of years. Might be interesting to look into this, I only know of organic material fossilizing like wood and bones for example. \\n\\n&gt;But you do. We never exploit the full deposit. We take out the core where it is worth the effort and leave the rest. Finding hollow deposit for various resources would be very curious.\\n\\nIt\\'s not as easy as it sounds. After sufficient time has passed it will be hard to tell what\\'s natural and what man-made. These \"hollow deposits\" will collapse over time, or get filled up. Have a look at this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dike_(geology) There are many ways something like it can and does occur naturally. \\n\\n&gt;Nothing as rapid as currently.\\n\\nI\\'m unsure if that\\'s true as of now (you\\'re probably confusing it with the predicitons), but it\\'s also not really important for the argument. A previous advanced civilization might have been smarter than us and stopped emitting so many greenhouse gases before they even got to the point of a feedback loop of a shrinking albedo effect, increased permafrost methane release aso.',\n",

Bacteria are evolving to break down some types of it already. Metals can stay for a long time. We should add glass to the list.\\n\\nReally depends on the exact material. There is no large scale breaking down of plastic by bacteria yet afaik. Most ends up in ocean sediment now. Some metals last long, others not so much. Glass isn't too bad.\\n\\nIn the geological record you'd also find traces of C14 and other radioactive isotopes if they had atomic bombs. And much more actually. If you find it an interpret it correctly that is. Geology is messy and we haven't come very far in that field yet.\"],\n",

There's little circulation forcing the cold northward ever, it just spins around Antarctica (with the fastest ocean currents and wind speeds of any ocean, due to no land mass blocking it's path). Antarctica had forests before it split from south America and the unimpeded current was allowed to form. Now the only plants are a couple of small flowering plants in the Antarctic Peninsula. It is also speculated that the formation of the unimpeded current 20 million years ago is what triggered the current ice age.\",\n",

You could only use them if you bailed out of your plane while it was straight and level, as far as I remember. And they were unreliable, being designed for stationary balloons, not planes that were on a crash course. Your odds were legitimately better if you attempted a controlled crash, which is a lot less dangerous at the low speeds biplanes flew at. Germany was the only country to have parachutes on planes and they did not work very well.\\n\\nExperienced pilots were very hard to come by. For many countries, pilots had a **much** higher death ratio than men in the trenches. It was in everyone's best interests to keep them alive as effectively as possible.\",\n",

And dk why they never publish. \\nBackstory: I applied for a summer internship at Uber in San Francisco with an idea to help them save on driver incentive costs. However, I was not given the opportunity to work there and yet my idea had been adopted and implemented in Singapore. On hindsight, I realized how my idea infringed on the foundation of meritocracy (work hard and be rewarded)\\n\\nHere\\'s my opinion:\\nWith ride-hailing apps such as Tada, Filo, Ryde and GoJek emerging to compete for a slice of the pie after Uber\\'s exit, consumers would once again enjoy discounts and promotions when these ride-hailing apps start to compete with each other to gain ground on market share. However, we must not overlook the role drivers play in capturing market share for these companies in the \"taxi\" industry, therefore we can conclude that these ride-hailing companies would eventually roll out driver incentives to attract drivers to join their ranks. Example: Uber used to dish out incentives weekly for a certain number of trips clocked. \\n\\nImagine this scenario: 49 trips are required to be clocked in a week for a $200 incentive. \\nLet\\'s assume an area say \"Tampines\" with a 10 minutes radius which coincides with Uber\\'s narrative of waiting less than 10 minutes for a ride.\\nThere is one consumer waiting for a ride in Tampines to take her to Clarke Quay.\\nThere are only two drivers in Tampines.\\nDriver A is closer to the consumer.\\nThere is one hour left on the clock to the end of the week.\\nDriver A needs 1 more ride to make 49 trips to collect his incentive.\\nDriver B needs 20 more rides to make 49 trips to collect his incentive.\\nWho do you think should be assigned the trip?\\nThe ride should be assigned to the driver closest to the consumer.\\nHowever, the algorithm can be designed in such a way that the ride goes to the driver with the least number of rides clocked that week, and since it fits into their 10 minutes narrative, driver incentive costs can be saved by spreading out the total number of rides to all existing drivers in the area, systemically allocating them.\\nThis goes against the foundation of meritocracy because Driver A has been working hard (putting in hours) yet the ride went to driver B.\\n\\nWith this opinion, I hope that the government would start an initiative to prevent these companies from designing their codes in a way that will infringe on the foundation of meritocracy, or even limit the use of such algorithms before drivers hit their incentives.\\n',\n",

And i definetly will be wary of those who insist that their religion should be taught to kids.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nAnyway teaching religious education is not the same as teaching homosexuality.\\n\\nWe are not telling kids its okay to be of religion X or religion Y, or that such people exist. It has to do with cultural awareness, so that kids who grow up to be adults learn how to conduct themselves among the different religious people, be aware of their sensitives etc.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThere is absolutely no need to introduce homosexuality to kids, why should we confuse kids about their sexuality at such an age? Let them grow and figure it out for themselves.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;And Tango Make Three is a very good example of this.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nI would put more responsibility on the parents to ensure they vet through the books before allowing the children to borrow them.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHowever, nlb didnt remove it, they moved it to the adult section under the directions of a minister. They are a public library funded by taxpayers. Public policy have to reflect a certain level of majority will. If the majority of people believe in traditional family values and do not think exposure to homosexuality is age-appropriate for children, then thats how public institutions are going to act.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;You do realize that sex ed is taught at around the age of 15, right? It's certainly not taught to children.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;The idea that teens (on the cusp of adulthood) should not be taught actual facts about sexuality just because you disagree with it is ludicrous. For someone who's a libertarian, I have no idea how you can even support active educational censorship.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nHmm isnt there some sex education at primary? Anyway teens around the age of 15 are children too. Their parents still have a right to not expose them to homosexuality education, especially when there is no need to.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEhh i said i was a Libertarian on that issue, not in all. Even then a libertarian would rather a parent have some control over their kid’s education than a gov forcing knowledge on their children.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFunny how your brand it as censorship of facts. There are certain things that are appropriate to teach to children and some are not. We don’t teach about the facts of open relationships, polygamy or masturbation. Is it censorship then?\\n\\nI can flip it around and see your insistence as a promotion of homosexual culture and lifestyle to kids. A libertarian certainly would want that forced into his kid.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n&gt;It's a wedding cake. There are two types of weddings.

If you're not willing to abide by the laws in place, then don't open a business. I'm not sure how someone who broke the law is an actual victim.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nYou can cite anti-discrimination laws until you are blue in the face, it doesn’t matter, it wasn’t discrimination.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Nobody was denied service based on their identity!!!**. The gay couple could have asked for a cake for their birthday, they would have got it. A straight couple could have asked a wedding cake for their friends gay wedding, they would be denied. So how can you pin discrimination on this?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nYou know whats funny, there was another case brought in front of the Col Commission, William jack vs azucar bakery. He wanted the bakery to write the quote “Homosexuality is a detestable sin” on a cake, but he was denied. He then sued but lost, the commission found that the bakery did not discriminate\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo refusing to write biblical verses on the cake? Not discrimination. Refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding? Discrimination!!!!\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe fuck?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nShould that  bakery have acceded?

You don\\'t see racial/religion intolerance in Singapore for a reason, and NS contributes some parts of that.\\n\\n- personal health benefits, I\\'m sure Singapore young male adults are of the healthier ones among the young male adults of the world because of NS. I\\'m sure even our slightly weaker PES brothers can kick the asses of the others any time of the day.\\n\\nI could go on and on about why we need NS. As a recently ORD-ed NSMen, yeah conscription sucks major dick and it sucks having to be the one to go through NS, but it sure is necessary af for both ourselves and the nation.

But even so, those who go to the Malay national secondary schools could take Chinese if it highly in demand in that school/area. There is also a more competitive type of Chinese secondary school which is comparable to SAP schools (SMJK) which are ALSO national schools, teaches humanities in Malay and sciences in English, but has more dedicated Chinese classes with longer hours. Lastly, there is the type of fully Chinese medium school that you are talking about, Chinese independent high school (persendirian) that teaches everything in Chinese and has a separate set of exams not recognised by the Malaysian gov.\\n\\nIt's ok I don't want to waste time talking to you.

One of the solutions the government actually is trying to implement is the Flexible Work Award. I think it\\'s a step in the right direction. However, how the company actually implement it, and whether the company is trying to \"game\" the system, we can never control. My gripe regarding this area is that the same people who are arguing for better work-life balance tend to also lambast this cynically. You have the right idea. The point is to be productive, not clock hours in the office doing nothing. The main problem at work is the same everywhere, you wait to rush, and rush to wait. All because of pipeline congestion and bottleneck. Allowing flexiwork schedule enables the worker to rest when the bottleneck is stuck instead of reporting to the office and doing nothing.\\n\\n&gt; Then we get to social security vs lower taxes. ... Stack that on top of progressive workplaces, and honestly housing becomes the only real cost you have left besides basic living like food and electricity.\\n\\nI would like to correct one misconception. Despite what people are saying. CPF is NOT a tax. Yes, it functions similar to a tax and social security system rolled into one. But the idea is that you are using your own money instead of the money of the future generation to fuel your own social security. E.g. your pension, your insurance, all paid for using your own money and not taxpayer\\'s money. So in the event that you are old and not working/paying taxes, you are still effectively using your own money for pension and insurance instead of taxing the already shrinking working class.\\n\\nSocial security is fine, but I do not want a safety net where people can lounge around. Sure, the people who desperately need the net vastly outnumber the number of people who abuse the system, but our country has to be productive to survive. We cannot rely on natural resources. Hence the Tharman\\'s Social Trampoline idea. The government would try their best to ensure you have food on the table and roof over your head. But if you are willing to put in the effort to improve yourself and your productivity, the government will help you bounce back and fly higher. That is not to say people who desperately need a net should be forced to work. We still have various government schemes that help them. (The NCSS website have more information on that)\\n\\n&gt; Then let\\'s talk about freedom of speech. ... So if we\\'re not going to protect our vulnerable populations, who will?\\n\\nI personally do not believe in unrestricted freedom of speech. But I do believe in debating what are the restrictions and to hold a review programme regularly to lift or add to the restrictions based on the needs of the people.\\n\\nI support the LGBT rights and their freedom to express themselves. But realistically, we are a nation that is treading on the minefield called religion. The pressure cooker is only kept stable because we carefully balance the religious freedom of different religion. And even then, we have racist/bigoted comments regarding other religion already. The one thing that most of the religious community have in common is their disdain for the LGBT. There is no point in creating a common enemy for them to fight.\\n\\nThe majority of the more conservative people are from older generations. And it\\'s harder to change their mind than to, for lack of a better phrase, wait for them to go away. I applaud and support the pink dot for sparking and maintaining the conversation regarding LGBT, but we should make sure progress does not come at the expense of stability. Hence the government\\'s reluctance to repeal 377A (even though it is a stupid law of the past). And since the government literally closes both eyes with what you do in the privacy of your own house, LGBT\\'s are not literally driven into a corner to be executed. The government is now trying to appease both sides of the quarrel by allowing LGBT their private space to do what they want while acquiescing to the religious demands of the conservatives without outright discrimination against the LGBT community. That is to say, Singapore has a \"Don\\'t ask, don\\'t tell\" policy. Baby steps.\\n\\nAmos Yee was punished because he was purposely stirring shit in the religious community that we tried so hard to appease and make them coexist with each other. It\\'s not about him insulting the Christians or the Muslims for that matter. It\\'s him stirring shit in anything he can think of, so the government have to step in to make him stop, with whatever charges they can think of before he gets mobbed.\\n\\n&gt; So now going back to my two initial points ... exhausted sooner, and more mentally troubled.\\n\\nThis I agree with too. The combination of increased information flow (and thus the flow of bad news), slowing down of the global economy, speeding up of technology, widening income gap in all major cities, and general anti-foreigner views of major cities are causing people to be pressured and exhausted. \\n\\nMy gripe is that they know something is happening, but they do not know what or why. They pick a side and stick to it, simultaneously demonizing the other side. Nobody wants to reach across the line to make peace. \"You are either with us or against us.\" The fact that to understand the people across the line takes an immense amount of time and effort does not help matters. So with their ignorance, they keep talking about what \"should be\" while failing to take into consideration \"what is\". They backseat drive without know about the road, the car, or even where they are.']}),\n",

       "                         {'9hapy4': [\"actually, I quite disagree with our inability to support the kinds of policies that we see that are similar to Western European countries. I think we're fully capable of some of them. When we think about Singapore economically, in my view there are two main things we have to consider: the first of which is that our biggest source of revenue is petroleum refinery, and the second of which is that it is truly our people who are our greatest economic asset. \\n\\nAs such the only policy I would agree with you on is that blanket bans on immigration is a *very* bad idea.  Singapore takes an economically traditional liberal perspective in terms of workers rights and working conditions. When we speak of shorter working hours, it's not that it's not possible, but that we think that the only way to make it happen is to reduce output and quality. I don't quite agree. Some forms of production require a set number of hours - think something along the lines of baking bread. You can't rush that. But for other things, especially corporate work, it really depends on the productivity and efficiency of each individual worker. This for me is where communist competition comes in. If you're not competing for favour and wages, you're collaborating on work that needs to be done. I would argue that a system in which workers receive better working conditions and shorter hours which are not as stupidly toxic and cutthroat in the way we see them now, would be much more conducive to effective and efficient work. A supportive work environment would help people feel supported and not alone, and therefore also increase retention, willingness to work, and job fulfilment. This isn't anything revolutionary, it's just management 101 stretched further.\\n\\nThen we get to social security vs lower taxes. This is one or the other, really. Personally I'm on the side of social security. How many of us know and ailing grandparent who needs a lot of medical attention and physical, mental, and emotional labour to take care of? How many of us have medical bills every month that aren't small? So on and so forth. There is a huge volume of people who require medical attention, but who don't do it because of the cost. The government subsides a sizeable amount, but it's still fairly expensive, especially on low incomes. Let's take another look at our taxes: 25% to CPF, x% for income tax, where x is anywhere between 0 and ~22%. We actually don't have very low taxes. It's entirely possible to fund a social security programme that encompasses healthcare, education, and retirement benefits. I think under those circumstances, raising taxes by an additional 5% is not a crazy idea. But wait, you say. What about housing? Well, under the circumstances of not having to pay for healthcare and education, housing becomes a lot more affordable. Stack that on top of progressive workplaces, and honestly housing becomes the only real cost you have left besides basic living like food and electricity.\\n\\nThen let's talk about freedom of speech. I hope you realise that a lot of our problems come from the presence of and lack of freedom of speech. It's not a monolithic thing that protects the peace in the country, it's something that is applied unevenly. Being unable, for example, to screen movies and media materials that do not showcase homosexuality and transgenderism as inherently negative things raises social stigma and discrimination against already vulnerable populations. Being able to get away with the above also means that the cycle of negativity continues. It's not just that some people don't have voices, it's that the people who do aren't policed for the terrible things they do or say. When was the last time we heard of someone being punished for discriminating against a gay person? I haven't. When was the last time we heard of someone being punished for insulting Christians? Amos Yee. The application of the laws, because they assume neutrality, is fundamentally going to be balanced towards those who have more social, political, and economic capital. So if we're not going to protect our vulnerable populations, who will?\\n\\nSo now going back to my two initial points: what are Singapore's greatest assets? I think it's in education. I think we need to relook our education system and means of testing, to redefine what it means to have a Singaporean education, to train our citizens to think, be critical, be innovative. We can't have that while suppressing freedom of speech. It's also hard to have that while worrying about living concerns. I think we can afford to implement policies that cost money and policies that will change the direction of Singapore, because we can't afford not to. The world is changing and we have to secure our place in it, and we're not going to do that by stagnating in these respects. We like making small tweaks, but once in a while having the courage to make the leap is necessary. I think this is necessary because it sets the stage for our further development in the 21st century, because we as a population are getting jaded earlier, exhausted sooner, and more mentally troubled. \"]}),\n",

But it shouldn't take a person so much effort to realize that people who were friends of family of victims could still be traumatized even after 17 years. The same goes for WW2. As an example: the Japanese. Many of us from the young demographic are indifferent to Japanese people. But if you were to ask an elder in Singapore who had possibly experienced the terror of Sook Ching, they might still have anti-Japanese sentiments even after, what, 50 years(?) have passed.\\n\\nJust because we did not experience a traumatic historic(al) event and thus not have any feelings to it doesn't mean we should make jokes about.

If you post ‘[certain race] are dumb lol’, a few people would probably get angry but not to the extent that they would report it. But if you post ‘I want to **kill** all the [certain race]’ which is very similar to terrorism, would you *not* report it? \\n\\n2) Does it matter that they are your ‘friend’ or not? If a stranger made the above killing claim, you would probably report it. If your friend made the claim, would you? If you don’t, then this is what we call ‘double standards’. It also shows that you are willing to be friends with a racist, but that your personal matter. Either way, whether someone is your friend or not should not affect your decision to report, unless you have friendship over national and global security, then I wouldn’t say you are a very safe citizen to begin with.\\n\\n3) Is it truly a ‘joke’? I think this is similar to point one. Calling someone dumb may be a joke, but killing? You may argue that ‘they joked about killing in a light tone’, but remember, this is the Internet where written tone cannot be conveyed.\\n\\nNow let’s assess the meme in question. ‘Just do it’. Do what? Crash planes into buildings. 1) Is this a mere ‘lol you dumb’ meme? No, it is advocating violence, terror, and **killing**. 2) Do you have double standards? I give the benefit that you do not. Then whether nyjcmememachine is run by your friends or not does not matter. 3) Is it a ‘joke’? To us tech-savvy people who see memes everyday, maybe. **But what about those who do not know what meme culture is?** Would it be a joke to them, or a statement?\\n\\nI think the conclusion on whether reporting was justified is pretty clear.

If we allow slightly deviant, we will eventually allow very deviant, because when slightly deviant is considered okay, very deviant will then  e considered slightly deviant, and when history repeats itself, slightly deviant bestiality will be considered normal\\n\\nBut the reality is that the repeal of 377a is based on consent. That's the qualitative difference, and therefore won't lead to a slippery slope. Slippery slope is only valid when one thing is a more severe version of another thing, when there is a quantitative difference but not qualitative. Regardless of how deviant or not you think gay sex is, that's not the point. The point is that all consensual sex should be allowed.

The human brain simply cannot handle 4 million individual cases. Maybe one day we'll be ruled by computers and they'll be able to treat us as individuals, but an organic brain cannot.\\n\\nSo, I'll by default ban siblings from reproducing, and if they're so confident they have perfect genetics, they can pay for a test for exemption.\\n\\nI cannot ban a couple from trying again and again to have a fully functioning child, but that's because of public morals, not individual logic. My objective isn't to help humans evolve through eugenics. It's to eliminate as many burdens on society as **reasonably** possible. Logic would dictate that we engage in eugenics. But we as a society are more than logic. Logic would also dictate that we eliminate the arts and focus only on STEM. But we have emotions. Making people happy is an equally noble cause as making people healthy or comfortable.\\n\\nEugenics is horrible because people are imperfect. Communism fails because people are imperfect. Does capitalism really really work with all the inequality it creates? The faults are because people are imperfect. It's foolish to strive for a perfect system of government when it's just going to be run by imperfect humans, on imperfect humans. We can only make do with the best we have. Which means capitalism, personal freedom despite poor quality genes, etc etc. If we really wanted a perfect system, we'd lose our humanity in the process of achieving it.\\n\\nI'm going to stop typing now because I've gone off topic.

We're making these laws based on current norms, not those from centuries ago \\n\\nI'm against using incest to reproduce. I'm also against grooming. If someone grows up with a younger sibling and they end up wanting to bang, there is a strong possibility that some grooming was involved. It's a much different relationship than childhood friends, before you bring that up. If it was somehow proven that these two siblings are truly legitimately attracted to each other, I say go for it.

It is fair for you to give me $3 for a plate of chicken rice. It is not fair for you to give me $30 for a olate of chicken rice. Even though it's still exchange of money, one is fair and one is not. But since the difference is purely quantitative, the slippery slope applies. Over the years, price of chicken rice increases. We know this as inflation.\\n\\nI endorse eugenics to the point that the bebefits outweigh the cost. Do we really need to evolve? Not really. But should we do what we can to curb genetic diseases? I would say yes. You're free ti say no. As far as I know, it has been scientifically tested and confirmed that incest runs a higher risk of problematic offspring. It has not been scientifically tested that any given couple has an increased risk. A sample size of 1 or 2 can be put down to bad luck. Therefore, I will not ban them. I'm making my decisions based on science, not luck.\",\n",

If I can't, the exception is invalid and the entire rule must be reworked. I have yet to find a reason to ban incestuous fun. Unless it falls under a different rule, such as don't groom kids.\\n\\nCome on, obviously I'm not talking about super atas chicken rice. Or paying for delivery. That's paying for not having to walk, not for the food itself.\\n\\nI'm glad that I'm noticeably consequentialist. My personal system is derived from consequentialism, but I give value to emotions. I used to be pure consequentialist, but that had its problems. For example, purely logically, Stalin was irrefutably right to force people into horrible working conditions for the good of the USSR. But it was clearly a great wrong. So there must be a reason. The only way I can justify calling Stalin a bad man is by shifting the ultimate goal of existence from technological advancement to happiness. And that makes far more sense. \\n\\nI believe that all people must work toward a goal. That is my most fundamental belief. Therefore, only a moral system that is goal oriented can be valid. Deontology is based on the journey. But in the past few years, I've been unable to come up with a journey that's worthwhile unless it has a worthwhile goal. Sometimes the journey is the goal. But the common factor is still the goal, even if it's not a single lump sum payoff at the end. My system includes some traits that seem deontological on the surface, but on further analysis are revealed to be consequentialist. \\n\\nFor every question, I have to ask 'why' and question the answer again and again until a concrete reason pops up. 'Because it's right' isn't a concrete reason because right is subjective. But happiness is not. If you're happy, nobody can make the argument that you actually aren't. There id an absolute amount of dopamine in your brain. That's a concrete fact.\\n\\nAll laws infringe on personal freedom. Therefore all laws are unjust. However, they also improve society in some way, supposedly. If the latter outweighs the former, then they become justified.  The only way to say a law is unjust is to say that the freedom it sacrifices is worth more than the safety (or etc) that it grants. This is subjective. \\n\\nIf I were a dictator, I would ban any couple who is unable to have normal offspring from having children. Unless they can find a way to have normal offspring. Or if they have a significant chance to have a defective child, I would ban them too  if that was scientifically proven. But again, if they solve their problem, then go ahead.\\n\\nHowever, if I were a democratically elected leader, and I believed myself to be the best man for the job, I wouldn't do this. Knowing that it would make me lose the next election, the good I could do with other policies outweighs the loss of 'goodness' by allowing more instances of genetic diseases into the world. I could implement a less heavy handed approach, but I can't think of one right now. If I actually thought I could solve all the world's problems, I'd go into politics.\\n\\nOh and one more reason I won't support practical eugenics (I support the idea, but it would never work). Just like the reason communism fails, and capitalism allows poverty, because people suck. Who gets to decide what's bad enough to be banned? Cerebral palsy is pretty bad, I think everyone would agree the world would be a better place if we eradicated that. But what about a citrus allergy? Is that bad enough to take away someone's right to have kids? I don't think so, but I'm not going to be the dictator. Whoever becomes the dictator might disagree. By my own judgement, I think I could fairly decide what is or is not as bad. By his judgement, he thinks the same of himself. And so does everyone. Therefore, my judgement on myself is invalid. I would need an entire committee to decide. And what if the result is decided by a difference of 1 vote? That falls within the bounds of uncertainty. So do we do it then? I can't say. No human can. I don't even think a computer can.  So just like communism, eugenics cannot be effectively carried out by humans on humans. And since we're dealing with humans, I would vote against eugenics even though it is objectively a good idea\",\n",

My shitty ex-roommates had left 18 pounds of cheap meat in there, and I was so preoccupied by my thoughts of “who the fuck even does that” that it wasn’t until after it was all in the bottom of the can that it occurred to me that the trash had just come the day before. \\n\\nHm. Well, the lid will be closed. It’ll be fine. Right?\\n\\nOn Friday, I exited the house and was greeted by several dozen flies. Ah. I’ve fucked up. This is immediately apparent to me. Well, it’ll just have to wait until trash day.\\n\\nSaturday. I need to take the kitchen trash out. I leave it outside, figuring that I can just wait until after the can has been cleared. \\n\\nSunday. Raccoons have been in my bagged garbage. I need to take care of that. Hesitantly, I open the can lid. Oooooooh boy. In a split second, I get the immediate impression that there are hundreds of maggots in the can. I’m short—just barely 5’3”, So this was based entirely on the ones I could see far up the sides of the can. But I’m fairly tough, I think. I’ve pulled maggots out of a baby skunk’s leg wound before. And I’m  a budding baby biologist. I can handle this. So I throw the bag into the can.\\n\\nI am now sure there are at least 1000 maggots in the can. \\n\\nMonday. Otherwise known as today. I gear up. Poison, rubber gloves, eye protecting glasses, a face mask, and a box of moth balls. I can do this. I’m a scientist. I throw open the lid. It had not occurred to me that they might be on the underside of the lid.\\n\\nThere were at LEAST a thousand maggots JUST on the underside of the lid. These rained down everywhere, their hideous bodies plopping onto the ground. I thank my lucky stars none got on me. I screamed like I was being murdered, an entirely involuntary sound wrenched from somewhere deep in my spine. I sprayed. And I sprayed, and I sprayed. I walked around and sprayed the writhing layer of maggots on the underside of the lid. I sprayed at the ground. A fly flew at my face and I gave up, running back inside, sobbing. \\n\\nFor a while, I watched from my back window as they crawled around on the can and the ground. I called my mom, who laughed at me. I called my dad, who was seven hours away and couldn’t help. I called my boyfriend, who was five hours away and without a car. I’m here for school; I have friends, but none good enough to help me with something like this.\\n\\nAnd it’s Labor Day. I called eight different pest control places until I found one that was both open and able to send someone out. I’m currently awaiting my savior, who should be here in a few hours. I’ll update with the cost of him coming out. \\n\\nTL;DR: grew maggots in 100° weather for a week, made it rain when I tried to take care of it. Now scarred for life. \\n\\nOn the bright side, I now know for a fact that as much as I enjoy learning about bees and ants, I should not apply to that entomology master’s degree program I was looking at. \\n\\nEdit: the bug man came, he was super sweet, really excellent. If anyone in the Round Rock/Austin area needs pest control services, PM me, I’d be very happy to pass his info on. He didn’t charge me, said I reminded him of his daughter, so I gave him the money I had set aside for a tip. \\n\\nAlso: I threw out the meat because I didn’t know if it was safe or not. I have no idea when it was frozen, most of it was unlabeled, and I have no way of knowing how long they waited between buying the meat and freezing it. If you want to be mad at someone, be mad at my ex roommates for buying and failing to eat 18 pounds of meat before moving across the country.',\n",

One that you\\'d hear in the depths of hell. In my instinct driven spasm I somehow broke the toilet seat and my ass fell into the fucking toilet. I was in a primal state I can\\'t even explain. I was desperately flaying my body around like a dying fish trying to find this ass demon but I couldn\\'t find it anywhere.\\n\\nMy neighbors were extremely worried thinking I was dying of a heart attack/seizure/stroke in their bathroom, but I didn\\'t give two shits. My inards were being harvested by some kinda alien species, why the fuck would I care what they think?\\n\\nAfter about 45 seconds of searching for the little shit I started coming to my senses. If there really was something living in my anus, where the fuck did it go? Then I looked down, and felt the worst embarrassment in my entire life.\\n\\nThe black, slithering, slimy, snake like worm wasn\\'t a parasite, it was my hoodie string. I just destroyed my neighbor\\'s toliet, screamed caveman like shouts, and threw my body around like a retarded octopus, over a fucking hoodie string.\\n\\nMy neighbor\\'s concerned voice turned into a \"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN THERE???\" At this point and I was speechless. I tried to muster up some kind of explanation but I could only mutter \"Im...Im so...sor....sorry.\" I was scared to open the door, but I knew it had to be done.\\n\\nI opened it to see the faces of a family that won a free trip to a zoo, but got tricked into going to an insane asylum. They just stared at me. I just stared back while covered in shit water and a face of a man who survived the Holocaust.\\n\\nI didn\\'t know what to say so I just muttered \"I\\'ll see myself out.\" and they didn\\'t even respond. I silently waddled out the door and walked to my house with a broken soul.\\n\\nI feel terrible. I broke their toilet and obviously need to compensate them for the damages, but I dont know if I can ever see them again without having horrible flashbacks. I truly am a lost man. I will never be the same.\\n\\nTL;DR I thought my hoodie string was a parasite from my anus and broke my neighbors toliet.']}),\n",

       "                         {'9e73m5': ['This actually happened over the summer, when I was studying abroad in Germany. Sometime mid July. I\\'ll also be honest up-front, I don\\'t have proof that this was an attempted abduction, because I got away at the end. It\\'s nevertheless clear that there were sinister motivations, so the \"best\" possible situation was an attempted date rape.\\n\\nAt the end of the semester, I traveled around a bit with my (now ex) boyfriend, who was also in Germany for a summer job, but lived in a different city than me. One place I REALLY wanted to go was Trier, the oldest city in Germany, so he and I booked train tickets and planned to meet there for a weekend. Unfortunately, it turned out that Trier wasn\\'t much of a destination (even though I thought it was super cool), so the only train my boyfriend could get would have him arrive at 1am on Friday night, whereas my train got into town at about 3 in the afternoon. No big deal, though, I figured just see some sights on my own and stay up to let him into the hotel when he got there. \\n\\nAt about 9pm on that Friday, I was done walking around but it was still light out (summertime) and the main square was still really hopping with people out for the evening, so I decided that I\\'d buy a beer from a grocery store (yes, I\\'m super cheap) and just sit on one of the benches in the square enjoying the atmosphere before heading back to the hotel for the night. So far, so good. \\n\\nI\\'m sitting in the square sipping my beer, and this maybe mid-30s guys starts chatting with me in English because he\\'s Pakistani. This isn\\'t so unusual, since the whole \"backpacking across Europe\" thing is still sort of a thing, so young travelers often chat with each other in my experience. I\\'m kind of uncomfortable at this point, but that\\'s just because I\\'m an awkward introvert who hates talking to strangers. The whole time we\\'re talking, I\\'m kind of thinking *\"wow, I can\\'t wait for this conversation to end so I can go back to the hotel and Reddit\"*. \\n\\nOnce I finish my drink, though, he notices and asks if I\\'d like to go to a bar and get a drink. I\\'m a total homebody who doesn\\'t do things like go to bars with strange men, so I decline, but eventually he persuades me to move to an outdoor table at a street-side cafe. *Ok,* I think, *I\\'ve got plenty of time before my boyfriend gets here. I\\'ll have one soda pop and then excuse myself.*\\n\\nNope. As soon as the waitress comes over, before I can open my mouth, the guy orders two beers- one for each of us. Still, two drinks isn\\'t much. I knew I could more than handle it, and I decided I\\'d accept the one drink, but no more (not to mention I don\\'t like Pilsners, which is what he ordered. Hefe-Weizen for life.) We\\'re chatting, and he asks if I\\'m alone in Trier or with friends, so I say that I\\'m with a \"friend\", meaning my boyfriend. He immediately follows with asking if this \"friend\" is male or female, and seems disappointed when I say male. (Yes, in hindsight I should have said \"boyfriend\", but remember that this boyfriend is now my *ex*, as mentioned above, and at this point we were already on course to break up, so it wasn\\'t quite so cut-and-dry what we \"were\".) However, this may have been what saved me later.\\n\\nAfter we finish the beers, he starts complaining that the cafe isn\\'t showing the world cup game, even though Germany was playing that night. I should have excused myself then, but he convinced me to move out of the main square to a side street and to sit down at another outdoor cafe where we can see a TV screen. Again, he immediately orders me a beer. \\n\\nNow I\\'m going into my third drink in less than an hour, which is more than I care to drink alone in a strange city with a strange man. When the waitress arrives and gives us our glasses, he immediately started saying that he was going to order us both shots as well! This is where I put my foot down... except he ignores that. Despite me saying \"no\" to the shots multiple times, he got up and went to find the waitress to order the shots, probably so that I *couldn\\'t tell her that I didn\\'t want one*. \\n\\nNow it\\'s really clear that he\\'s trying to get me drunk, and I really don\\'t want to be drunk. Again, yes, hindsight is 20/20. I should have taken his absence from the table as my opportunity to disappear, but I\\'m an idiot. A lot of why I didn\\'t leave is because he didn\\'t really do anything \"wrong\", if that makes sense? He didn\\'t make lewd comments or grab me or anything- the only \"wrong\" thing he was doing was being very persuasive and then ignoring my protests against more drinks. Otherwise, he was very friendly and polite, so out of a desire to also be polite, I stayed. Ladies: learn from my mistake, and DON\\'T STAY IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS JUST TO BE POLITE. \\n\\nEven though I stayed at the table, I\\'m not a *complete* moron, so while I was alone, I dumped half of my beer into the potted plant next to me. I\\'m really not sure if he noticed, because he didn\\'t say anything about it, but the plant was still fizzing when he returned... oops.\\n\\nNow we\\'ve got two shots in front of us and partially drunk beers. I finish both and run in to the bathroom (that\\'s a 1.5liters in an hour and a half... I was bursting at the seams), only to return to find out he\\'d ordered us both another beer in my absence. This beer is now the 5th drink of the evening, and would put the volume of liquid at 2 liters. That\\'s hella beer, and I was really struggling to even drink it. \\n\\nWhile I\\'m super slowly sipping my beer, the guy started getting phone calls every few minutes. Now, I mentioned he was Pakistani before because that\\'s relevant now. I couldn\\'t understand the calls because he was speaking Urdu on the phone, but it was clear that someone was impatient with him and wanted him to hurry up, especially since they kept calling back over and over. He said it was some friends asking him to come hang out. Eventually, he got tired of waiting for me to finish my beer (I was REALLY struggling to drink it), so he says \"forget the beer, let\\'s go.\" He pays the tab and we start walking down the side street. \\n\\nNow it\\'s about 10:30pm. It\\'s dark. I decided to myself that one way or another, I would be gone and headed back to the hotel at 10:45. \\n\\nWhile we\\'re walking through the streets of Trier, an older Pakistani man suddenly comes up to us. His uncle, apparently, who speaks no German or English. I shake his hand and greet him anyway, then the guy stepped in between me and his uncle, so that I couldn\\'t see what they were doing... but I could hear the sound of paper money being exchanged and counted. Then the guy said \"thanks\", and we kept walking. \\n\\nAfter a little bit, we come to a hookah bar. The guy has been smoking cigarettes all evening, which is also pretty normal in Europe, but I have never smoked in my life and I don\\'t want to start (I can\\'t stand the smell), so I\\'d declined his offers of cigarettes. Now he\\'s trying to persuade me to go into the hookah bar (where his \"friends\" who\\'d been calling him are) and smoke a hookah and have another drink. Nope. I glance at my watch, and it\\'s 10:45, when I promised myself I\\'d leave no matter what. \\n\\nSo I begin to say that I couldn\\'t *possibly* stay and smoke a hookah because my (boy)friend\\'s train would be in at 11, and I said I\\'d be there to meet him (which is complete BS- he wouldn\\'t arrive for another two hours). I\\'m super clear that there\\'s a man expecting me very shortly, which gets him to finally back off (weird how that works), then I quickly walk away. Once I\\'m around the corner, I broke into a run for a bit to make sure I wasn\\'t being followed, then found my way back to the main square and then to my hotel, where I collapsed on my bed. Everything was swirling around me because of the booze, and the first thing my boyfriend said when he saw me 2 hours later was \"...are you drunk?\"\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**TL;DR** \\\\- I was an idiot and let a stranger get me drunk while I was alone at a bar in a foreign country, and he may have tried to sell me to a middle-aged man, but I ran away right before I walked into what was potentially a trap where his \"friends\" were waiting. *Never ever stay in a situation where you\\'re uncomfortable just to be polite!*',\n",

Theres nobody in sight, so we decide to start making out in the water, she gets on top of me and we start grinding, everything feels good but his is where the fuck up happens. We are both wearing bathing suits and *apparently* ocean water isnt a very good lubricant. After a while we decide its time to head back and we stop. As i get up i feel a sharp pain in my penis and a warmth in my pants. She screams because theres a small stain of blood on my pants. I look inside and see that my head is bleeding.

This happened today, etc etc. \\n\\nAfter a sleepless night that I can only chalk up to changing my sleeping schedule for my new job, and also because I wanted to watch Seinfeld more than I wanted to sleep. I dragged myself out of bed for the most absurd shift of my life. Oh, and I skipped breakfast because I’m an idiot. At this point of morning I’ve been awake for about 20 hours.\\n\\nI started my new job at a green grocer’s a few days ago. It’s a nice place, easygoing, solid clientele. The woman who is training me is 35 weeks pregnant and going on her maternity leave tomorrow. We’ll call her ‘S’. All morning S is talking to me about how excited she is to finally have a couple of weeks to herself. No work, no baby, just her and her couch. S started talking about how the baby felt kinda odd today, and I’m falling in and out of sleep while standing (about 28 hours awake at this rate) and start craving bacon and eggs. I’m willing to give my life for bacon and eggs. That’s unimportant, but I wanted to briefly talk about the last nice thing I thought about before chaos ensued. \\n\\nWe’re talking about how to cash up and close the store when suddenly S says \\n“oh”, and then she says “oooOOOH”. I’m not properly registering anything at this rate and am facing the register so I figure she’s bumped her knee or something. More casually than you should EVER ask a pregnant woman, I say “you all good?” \\n\\nSilence. \\n\\n“Uh, yeah, I think I’m okay. That was weird. Anyway, what you next have to do is - OH OH WHAT!” S has put her hands on her stomach and finally my idiot dial clicks from ‘oblivious moron’ over to ‘semi-aware dickhead’. This lady is in labour. I’m 23, and while I may be a woman myself I have no idea what the fuck to do so I start scrambling for the store owner who shouts “CALL THE AMBULANCE, I’LL CALL HER HUSBAND”. The sudden yelling from the manager, the contraction screams in the background, the bacon and eggs, and the customers witnessing the scene all set off some abominable reaction in my brain and the next thing I know I’m on the ground with the store’s owner leaning over me and instructing an onlooker to call a second ambulance. \\n\\nAnyway, things are a bit hazy here. I end up in the hospital on a drip with a doctor asking me a million questions. Eventually I’m released with one of those hospital sandwiches and a prescription to ‘rest up’. Finally I make my way home, eat my sandwich, take a nap, and am now preparing myself for the embarrassment I’ll no doubt face when I walk in to my shift tomorrow. \\n\\nTL;DR: no sleep + no eat = passing out in the middle of your shift after realising that your coworker has gone in to labour. \\n\\nDisclaimer: I don’t have any updates on S so if you feel like asking, I unfortunately can’t help out right now. I just hope she’s doing well! \\n\\nEdit: removed an unnecessary name. \\n\\nUPDATE: Currently on my break, and happy to report that S and her baby are okay! Baby arrived safely, and that’s all of the info I have. \\n\\nUPDATE 2: holy hell I did not expect this to get any attention. \\n\\nQuick FAQ:\\n\\n1) This morning I finally managed to eat my bacon and eggs before work and didn’t pass out today. The bacon and eggs were fucking amazing. Never skipping breakfast again. \\n\\n2) I live in Australia. Ambulance cover in my state costs $40 a year, so the ambulance ride was not expensive at all. Also, public healthcare is free under Medicare so the hospital stay, checkup, and sandwich were all free. Nice. \\n\\n3) Was Seinfeld worth this? Probably not, no.

I think “Great! I make money and I can help kids seeing what to expect on the exam by seeing the old ones”. \\n\\nThe fact that I scanned all my exams and kept them in my Google Drive to have them as possible study material made the whole process easier. I upload 5 documents from my Organic Chemistry class and get paid $25, I figure that I might as well do it for all the classes, more money to buy alcohol you know?\\n\\nIn the span of a couple days I upload about 120 documents for subjects such as OChem, Physics, Calculus that span from old exams to notes to summaries about the whole class, pretty much my old study materials.

I’m not exactly sure how much, in all honesty, because I just started chugging from the bottle at the end. \\n\\nI’m fully clothed in a jacuzzi full of bubbles, wearing Greg’s motorcycle helmet ( Pic Included here: https://i.imgur.com/80zq9Jv.jpg ).\\n\\nThis is at 9:11 P.M.\\n\\nHere is where the fuck-up becomes evident. \\n\\nSo, I take Prozac and Elavil. \\n\\nFor those of you who don’t know (much like my blissfully unaware self at that time) you are **not supposed to mix alcohol and antidepressants.** \\n\\nMy medicine and the alcohol met in my bloodstream, and rather than being friends they decided to duke it the fuck out with brass knuckles and all. \\n\\nI’m laughing and I fall out of the jacuzzi. Ouch, that hurt.\\n\\nSo I’m crawling on the floor, white girl wasted and covered in bubbles. And here is where everything starts going in and out. \\n\\nI remember Kyle was holding me on the floor asking if I was okay.\\n\\nI’m nodding my head yes, and then my leg starts shaking. It quits for a minute, and then the other one is twitching, and I’m laying on my side and i feel this *gut wrenching pull in my muscles.* I’m jerked into the fetal position, then my spine seems to decide it doesn’t like that, and I’m snapped the other way, my back arching as sharply as it could possibly be, and my arms are jerked backwards. \\nI’m convulsing on my friend’s concrete floor, and then I vomit and stop shaking for a minute. \\n\\nI don’t know how long this continues. I’m fading in and out. \\n\\nKyle is holding my head off the ground and telling me to look at him, Greg is in stunned silence, staring at me as I’m covered in my own stomach contents, and I begin to start the strange contortionist-like dance that is my body jerking itself in every way possible. \\n\\nI remember trying to crawl to the shower, as Kyle told me he needed to get the puke out of my hair. \\nI’m laying on the stonework floor of the shower, hot water raining down on me. Someone picking chunks of Taco Bell out of my hair. Everything smells like bile, vodka, and the 5 tacos I’d eaten earlier that day. \\n\\nMy body twitches, and I’m like “oh shit here it comes” and I’m fucking snapping back and forth, smashing my head, legs, arms, and any appendages I can against the wall of the shower, the shower bench, and anything within my vicinity. I vomit some more. I stop. The water is warm. It doesn’t hurt for a minute. I black out. \\n\\nI’m on the floor, and now I’m covered in towels, and Kyle tells me I ripped off my shirt shortly after the shower ended. I’m then wrapped in more towels so I’m not just swinging titty around like a damn carousel, and then I’m carried to Greg’s bed where I proceed to vomit in a trash can and pass out. \\n\\nSeveral hours later I wake up. \\n\\nI shakily put my dry clothes back on, look at the time. \\n\\nIt’s 5 a.m. \\n\\n\\nI have to be at Calculus by 8.\\n\\n\\n“Well shit.”\\n\\n\\nSpend the next hour grabbing my stuff and shaking Kyle awake to see if he’ll drive us home. \\n\\n\\nI get home by 7:20, take a shower to hopefully rinse off the ungodly scent that has implanted itself into my very being. I get to class at 8:30 still faintly smelling of vomit. \\n\\n\\nI’m still drunk. I go through all of my classes, still drunk. Physics was definitely interesting. \\n\\n\\nI go to work, and **that** is when my hangover decides to hit. \\n\\nI’m fucking feverish, I feel like I’m gonna puke, I’m fucking*covered* in bruises, customers are asking stupid questions, and I wrote a bitchy passive aggressive note to my supervisor about how I’m sick of her shit. \\n\\nNow she and I have the same shift today, and it’s time to see if I get demoted or just lose my job altogether. \\n\\nTL;DR\\n\\nI drank in excess, and blacked out, had seizures from my meds mixing with it. Go to work hungover. Might lose my job. \\n\\n\\nEDIT: \\n\\nYes, I am aware what I did was stupid. I appreciate your astute observations. \\n\\nAlso my supervisor called in today, so I trashed the note 😎\\n\\nEdit 2:\\n\\nSo just some clarifying things. \\n\\nMy friends did the best they could. Seizures are terrifying, and they were more focused on keeping me alive than what would normally be the logical choice of calling an ambulance. \\n\\nSo please stop saying I need new friends, and please stop telling I’m an idiot. I don’t really see either of those being helpful. I’m painfully aware of my mistakes. \\n\\nI hadn’t eaten. I am 5’4 and weigh 145lbs. It was however many shots in about three hours. I would normally stop at three, but I guess drunk me was like “*more*”\\n\\nI will be talking to my doctor about it, but I’m scared to. \\n\\nEdit 3:\\nSome of you fuckers don’t believe me, so here the few pics I have from the situation. Bruises, and the jacuzzi\\n\\nhttps://imgur.com/a/9zmj9A8/',\n",

Apologies if this is overkill and you\\'ve already read it! And honestly, I don\\'t know if it qualifies as a TIFU, so I am sure the mods will decide. Be gentle, mods...  Anyway, a very English break-in story is pasted below... \\n  \\nI may have over-egged the detail, so this story is quite long. The detail is pretty accurate, cos I made notes immediately after the event, and I\\'ve tried really hard to be honest and not embellish too much!\\n  \\nOn the first day of moving into my new house back in April of 2015, my neighbour came to introduce himself - and it wasn\\'t long before I deduced that he was in the drug-dealing business. I initially thought that wasn\\'t so bad, I like a smoke from time to time and having him next door could be useful. Even if I went back in time right now to warn myself, there\\'s no way I could convey how wrong I was... \\n  \\nNow 2015 was otherwise known as the worst year of my life. It certainly wasn’t what Back To The Future had let me to expect. \\n  \\nAfter losing my dad to cancer, my sister having a miscarriage and my BBQ exploding on my birthday gathering, I was beginning to think my luck would have to turn soon. It was August, the summer was ending and nothing bad had happened for two whole months…\\n  \\nI’d been up late watching It Follows, and not being much of a horror fan, I was suitably creeped out. And slightly high. My girlfriend had come home late from a work function and had gone straight to bed, and at about 12.30am I went up there too.\\n  \\nIt’s probably worth explaining that this house has three floors. The ground floor has an entrance, spare room and stairs, the first floor is the kitchen and living room, and the top floor is the bedroom and bathroom. It’s one of three houses in a little mews in a leafy Sussex village.\\n  \\nI went to bed and was soon drifting off. About 15 minutes later I heard some banging. I didn’t pay it much mind, assuming that watching a horror movie before bed had made me oversensitive. So I started to go back to sleep. The next memory I have is of shouting. Lots of shouting. The bedroom door burst open, and a group of large figures stormed in, brandishing crowbars.\\n  \\nI remember screaming in that way you try to in a dream, when nothing comes out. I also recall spinning around slightly so as to block my girlfriend, an incredibly sweet and innocent creature who had barely witnessed a crime in her life. I thrust out my legs, kicking one of them in the crown jewels firmly. This led the ring leader to crack me on the legs with a crowbar, telling me in no uncertain terms to not do that again.\\n  \\nSo now there are at least four men lined up alongside my side of the bed. Maybe five. Hard to tell, I didn\\'t get to put my glasses on. My girlfriend is screaming, they’re all shouting, and I’m incredibly confused. The ringleader then demands that I give him the bag of money.\\n  \\n“What money!?” I asked.\\n  \\n“Give us the fucking bag of money, we know you’ve got the bag of money!” the ringleader repeats. Several times.\\n  \\n“I don’t have a bag of money,” I explained. It’s hard to remember the order of events, but I do know one thing for sure - Tom Cruise popped into my head.\\n  \\nThe previous night I was watching Mission: Impossible 3. I do like that film, and I had it on in the background while I did the washing up. I remember pondering the scene where Ethan Hunt’s wife has a gun to her head. “I want to give you what you want, but you’ve got to do what’s right!” exclaimed Hunt. Hmmm. I wonder if the screenwriter had researched this dialogue. Is this what you are supposed to say in a hostage crisis?\\n  \\nWell, it apparently sewed a seed, because I found myself repeating those words.\\n  \\n“I don’t have a bag of money. I want to get you what you want, but you have to do what’s right and leave this poor girl alone,” are the words that came, strangely confidently, out of my mouth.\\n  \\n“Yeah? Well we know you sold drugs to my daughter!” said the one I considered to be the sidekick.\\n  \\n“Nah nah nah, it was my sister,” said the ringleader in correction.\\n  \\nThis exchange told me two things - one, they did not have a particularly good grasp of what their plan was, and two, they were after my neighbour.\\n  \\nFor my neighbour is a drug-dealing maniac. A weird guy from Essex. He’s in his mid-30s, about 5’8” with light blonde hair and eyebrows to match. He’s skinny and zany, usually hopping from one foot to the other as he tries to keep his excessive energy in check. He smokes weed from 7am, and boxes on his outdoor punchbag whenever the weed isn’t enough to keep his energy in check.\\n  \\nSometimes he can be seen in the communal car park making things. [Like the time he made a wooden triangle](https://i.imgur.com/2E6FGuw.jpg). Or he juggles balls with his dogs, or he shadow boxes. You know, the usual things you expect to see your neighbour doing at literally any hour of the day or night. \\n  \\nStill, realising that the intruders were in the wrong house, I wasn’t entirely keen on sending them next door. As much as I disliked my neighbour, I didn’t think he deserved a group of masked men storming in. So I continued to try and talk these people out of the house.\\n  \\n“I’m not a drug dealer, so I’ve no idea what you’re talking about. There’s a couple of Macbooks downstairs, sixty quid in my wallet, an iMac… whatever you want, just take it and go mate.”\\n  \\nHearing this offer, the ringleader realised I was being compliant. And if I was willing to give up a few grands worth of computers, why wouldn’t I just give him the bag of money he was seeking? Slowly, the cogs turned.\\n  \\n“Is this number 27?” he demanded to know.\\n  \\n“The whole area is.”\\n  \\n“Yeah but is this number two, twenty seven Acacia Avenue?”\\n  \\n“No, it’s number one.”\\n  \\n“WE’VE GOT THE WRONG HOUSE!”\\n  \\nThe realisation was startling. They all shouted. One guy had been searching every room, cupboard and drawer. He had given up already. One or two of the others went down stairs to get him, leaving me and my GF with the ringleader and his sidekick, a guy I suspected was far darker in soul than the guy doing all the talking.\\n  \\n“Right, you can’t call the cops or we’ll come back. We know where you live!” The sidekick said.\\n  \\nEmboldened by the realisation that these guys were morons, I laughed. “You seriously think I won’t call the cops? Best I can do is give you a thirty second head start.”\\n  \\nHe didn’t like that, so he took my phone. Good, I thought. I’ll track that fucker. Sadly, I later discovered, he threw it behind my sofa on his way out of the house.\\n  \\nThe ringleader then apologised. He said they were looking for someone else, and there had been a mix up. I said something along the lines of “well I am glad we sorted that out.” At which point he shook my hand, told me he hoped my GF would be ok, and forced the sidekick to leave with him.\\n  \\nI picked up the bed and jammed it against the door, and enveloped my traumatised girlfriend in a big hug and told her it was over. Which it almost was.\\n  \\nLittle did we know, the morons had decided to try again, this time knocking my neighbour\\'s door in and storming his house. But he was in the kitchen, so they went flying past him, up to the bedroom where they found his girlfriend. My neighbour, being the kind of guy he is, then jumped out of the window, abandoned his GF, ran to my front door and stormed into my home.\\n  \\n“THE-GO-KID! THE-GO-KID! THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MY HOUSE!” He screamed.\\n  \\n“No shit,” I responded. “Why do you think my fucking door is wide open?”\\n    \\nI went out to meet him while talking to the police on my GF’s phone. He grabbed a knife from my kitchen, the phone from my hand, and went after them. I decided I was done, went back to enjoy the barricade of the bedroom.\\n  \\nIt took the police a while to turn up, because the genius neighbour of mine told them they had guns, so we had to wait for armed response. Eventually, my GF and I cautiously walked down to the living room. The police eventually arrived, but they knew it was too late. So they stood outside our houses having a chat and a bit of a laugh. It’s likely to be the only time I tell four men with machine guns to shut the fuck up.\\n  \\nThe rest of the night was a mess of police as they took statements, searched for evidence and quizzed my neighbour about, yes, the bag of money. They were convinced they could bust him for something, as they had wanted to for some time. Turns out he had broken his foot when he leapt from the window, and so he was carted off in an ambulance. As the stretcher went past me in the car park, he tried to talk to me.\\n  \\n“Go Kid! I just want to say one thing mate! I just want to say one thing!” He screamed.\\n  \\n“Neighbour, you’re not physically capable of saying just one thing.”\\n  \\nThe police, who knew him all too well, erupted in laughter. This humiliation would haunt him for some time.\\n  \\nEventually I heard that my neighbour had claimed it was all because of an instagram picture he had posted on Facebook, and he thought he knew the ringleader. A scumbag he’d recently connected with on FB. He gave the police two weeks to charge the guy. To the credit of the police, they arrested him but didn’t have the evidence to charge him.\\n  \\nAbout a month later, my neighbour beckoned me into his garage where he remonstrated with me for blaming him for the ordeal. “They terrorised us too!” he said. He then told me he had taken matters into his own hands, dealing with the ringleader himself, putting him in some sort of box and, I presume, torturing him. He tried to show me some sort of video evidence but I refused to look at it. \"We have to look after our women!\" he said.\\n  \\nHe then said that he was aware I had reacted like a pussy when the guys got into my room. A bit bemused by this, I asked him if it was more gutless to scream or to jump out a window and leave my partner behind. This enraged him, and we haven\\'t spoken a single word to each other since.\\n  \\nThe only stuff that was stolen was money from our wallets and my Leatherman (it had \\'That\\'s not a knife\\' engraved in it). Nobody was ever charged with the break-in and eventually life went back to normal, albeit with a very expensive new front door. I moved house this year, so I can only hope I never see my neighbour\\'s face again.\\n  \\n I know some people find this story entirely unbelievable, but [it would appear I’ve got back-up on that front](https://ol.reddit.com/r/CasualUK/comments/9ey4pe/i_endured_the_most_english_home_invasion_ever/e5tap79/) as one of the responding officers is on Reddit and confirmed the story\\'s validity on my original post! \\n  \\nTL:DR - Masked men broke in, stormed my bedroom, realised they got the wrong house, said sorry and broke into next door instead. Also, my neighbour is a knob.\\n  \\nEdit: I\\'ve been encouraged to post this bit of info as well - \\n  \\nThe police called it a ‘scum on scum’ attack, and when those inadvertently mess with innocent bystanders, the scumbags are usually apologetic. They even said “don’t be surprised if you get an anonymous bunch of flowers”. We didn\\'t, but judging by some of the messages I have received, it really is something that happens. ',\n",

Here goes...\\n\\nI'm a seventeen year old Asian and a freshmen at a Community College. So, yesterday night I called my cousin and cried to him about how one of the classes I’m taking right now is one of the most difficult thing I ever came across (The class is Human Anatomy and Physiology). I told him that I was going to fail because of an exam on Thursday and I already failed a quiz. I have a difficult time learning especially when it involves anatomy (not a big fan). My cousin told me it was best to slow down because of all the homework, quizzes and exams from the other classes can cause me to stress. He offered to talk to my dad about the situation to which I agreed. I called my cousin because I knew my dad was going to think that I wasn’t fully giving the class my 100 percent. After a couple minutes of me crying alone my dad called me and asked why I was wanting to drop the class. I explain to him that I didn’t want to disappoint him because he invested so much money in me and I didn’t want the money to go to waste. Finally, me and my dad both agreed to go on Thursday to talk to an advisor and then we’ll decide.\\n\\nThen rolls today. I finished my classes and was about to head home when I received a text from my dad. He told me to go ask a advisor about dropping the class and whether we would get a refund. I did what he said, but this moment here is where I messed up big time. When I asked the front office about withdrawing, they handed me a withdraw slip and next thing I knew, I was out of the Human Anatomy class (looking back at it now, I made one of the most dumbest move ever). When I finished, my dad called went commando on me when I told him what I did. He said that it was best to keep the class and fail than withdraw (I think it was better to withdraw, because then my GPA won’t drop if I failed, but what do I know). He then proceeded to call me a useless stupid kid and question my actions before hanging up on me. I felt like shit there and then and still. While on the way home I felt like ending my life it would be quick and easy, but then I thought about my family and what they would have to go through. When I got home, my mom and grandma gave me a 10 minute lecture on why I made a shit move. They told me that my dad spends most of his time working 16 hours shifts nonstop and sleeps for only 5 hours before heading back to work just for me and I didn't even care that he goes through the pain. I cared and it hurt me, because I was the cause of my dad not being able to spend time with the family.\\n\\nI know it was a really bad decision made by me. Looking back, I wish I could just rewind time and stop it from happening. I feel like absolute shit right now and I question why my dad invested so much money on me. I know my dad is maybe wanting me to pay him back, because my dad paid for the class and I’m willing to with all the money I received from my uncles and aunts when I graduated High School.\\n\\nI apologize for making you read this stupid terrible written story, but I just couldn't hold it in me anymore. This is one example of why I always allow other to call the shots because in the end I always manage to fuck it up somehow. I just… need some time to be alone... and do my Pre-Calculus homework.\\n\\nTL;DR Withdrew from Human Anatomy and Physiology class without my dads order and he’s really pissed at me and my entire family probably hates me because I wasted so much money. Feeling like wanting to actually kill myself, but don’t have the guts to. Willing to pay the money back to my dad.\"]}),\n",

Also I\\'d like to point out that I did not know it was a hotel employee\\'s at the time.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nSo at around 1pm I call home and get the whole spiel about working hard. Without going into too much detail, I was just generally frustrated at the start of the day.\\n\\nAt 2pm my buddy and I are getting Five Guys, and I ordered a burger and a \"Little\" fry (smallest size they have). Little did I know that apparently it\\'s standard procedure for the workers to give you quadruple the amount of fries you expected. Not joking, the bottom half of the bag was *filled* with fries. I mean, free fries = no complaints here. But anyway, I ate my burger and as many fries as I could until I decided to save the rest for after class.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nAt 2:45pm I\\'m driving my buddy back to the hotel (19 of us live in a hotel while our new house gets built) and as I start to leave the lot, I see a car double-parked *directly center* over the yellow line. I didn\\'t take a picture, but believe me when I say the yellow line was directly center under the car. This balls-of-steel move paired with my previous frustration led to me getting *pissed*. This had to be deliberate. The person who parked like that had to have done it on purpose, just to be an asshole.\\n\\nI immediately thought of those business cards you see online that say \"You park like an asshole\", but realized that those cards sadly only exist in my dreams, so I scrambled for a plan B. That\\'s when I looked down at the greasy bag of projectiles at my feet. So with the blessing of God himself I mustered all my strength to grab that sweet, hefty scoop that only comes once in a generation, and I catapulted it out of my window at the back of the double-parked car. Only about four or five fries actually landed on the trunk, and the rest hit the ground. I then drove off with a big swinging dick, confident that I taught them a lesson the hard way not to double park.\\n\\n10 minutes later it\\'s 3:30pm and I\\'m in class, and I start to feel bad about doing it. After all, maybe the owner was in a rush or had a bad day too. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nThen a little later, the buddy I dropped off texts me and says the hotel staff is looking for me. And they\\'re pissed.\\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nThere were no cameras in the parking lot or really anywhere in the hotel, so you might ask, how did I get caught? Well, the hotel parking lot is right outside the window next to the front desk, so they saw the car that did it. I\\'ve also been living in the hotel for a few weeks now so they recognize me and my name, and they also recognize the car I drive because it sticks out from the rest. I also did it in broad daylight, so that didn\\'t help.\\n\\nAnyway, I immediately got worried because I both felt really bad and didn\\'t want to have to pay some huge fine. So I called the front desk after class and said \"Hi, I\\'m the guy who threw the fries at the car\". I then asked to speak with the car owner, and after profusely apologizing, I explained the whole situation, offered to both buy her a voucher for the car wash down the street, and last but not least, offered to pick up the fries. So I did. (I also apologized in person when I got back to the hotel.)\\n\\nIn the end, I was on my hands and knees picking up fries off the ground of a parking lot. And to add insult to injury, the ground was covered in tiny pieces of a broken bottle. \\n\\n&amp;nbsp;\\n\\nBut one last detail. After all of this, as I was slaving away picking up fries, I noticed something: the car was no longer double-parked. No, they moved it to a single parking space, like a civilized driver. For the rest of the day, I reveled in my little victory. Worth it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**TL;DR: Drove past a car in the hotel parking lot that was obviously double-parked on purpose, was already pissed at something unrelated, had a bunch of leftover fries, threw them out of my window at her car and drove to class, an hour later I got a text from my friend saying the hotel staff are looking for me. Ended up picking up fries off the ground which was conveniently covered in broken glass.**',\n",

I\\'m on mobile, you guys know the drill.\\n\\nSo while browsing this beautiful sub, I was suddenly reminded of the moment I discovered how low I can get as a human being. Thinking back on it, it\\'s kind of a funny story (and probably traumatizing for the poor kid and family involved), so since you guys have given me a lot of great stories, let me share mine.\\n\\nI was 19 at the time and working in a shitty IT helpdesk job. I just got off from work and I was going back home, anxious to get some food in my belly since it was 5pm and I haven\\'t eaten since last night. On my way back home, I get a call from my buddy.\\n\\n\"Yo cockmuncher, wanna grab some pizza and a drink or two at [insert places name]?\"\\n\\nMy growling stomach and lack of a will to live at that point thanks to my job made the sound of both pizza and alcohol seem erotic.\\n\\n\"Fuck yeah, meet me there in 10 minutes\"\\n\\n10 minutes later and we got a seat and a beer at one of the outside tables. Now this pizza place was a kind of bar/restaurant gig, with all the tables and chairs being outside. They had the absolute best pizzas, cheap alcohol and a massive playground so it was routinely packed with families and students. We start talking shit, downing our beers, smoking our lungs out and waiting for the pizzas to come out.\\n\\nOne other thing about this place: the pizzas take FOREVER. The prep work on the pizzas alone probably takes them half an hour. My buddy and I are on our third draft by the time the pizza comes. But man I creamed myself when I did see them come.\\n\\nWe proceed to slam back our beers and dig in. I down my entire brand new draft and feel the bubbles start to build up. Uh oh. I try to release the gas by burping but the bubbles are fizzing up faster than I can release them. On top of that, thanks to me not eating all day as well, my stomach is beginning to fight back against me in protest from the lack of care I\\'ve been giving it. This isn\\'t looking good.\\n\\nBeing the concerned friend he was, my buddy proceeded to laugh and slap me on my back, hard. And that bursts open the dam walls. In order to not throw up on our still hot from the oven pizzas, I turn my head to the side and let it all out, unable to contain it any more.\\n\\nAll over the toddler who was sitting at the table with his family next to us.\\n\\nAll I hear is my friend wheezing in the background, and the giant fucking bear of a man father emitting an arse puckering \"*WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU JUST DO*\"\\n\\nI grab some napkins and try to stand up so I can help this crying kid deal with the aftermath of my poor life choices, but then it hit me.\\n\\nFirst the alcohol, then papa bears fist.\\n\\nI lose my footing and I swear my soul leaves my body for a second. I rejoice, for mortal problems do not affect the dead. I snap back a second later and curse God and Satan for not taking me when they had the chance. Papa bear is standing over me and is about to smash his meaty fists into my face once again, and my drunken mind isn\\'t gonna stand for it.\\n\\nIn a drunken fury I rolled to the side of his pavement-smashing fist and stood up, my rage and adrenaline momentarily burning away the last few beers. And we spar.\\n\\nIt lasts about 5 seconds before he picks me up like I was a toy and throws me against the wall. By this point the manager and a few of the beefier staff have arrived. Seeing that I\\'m already no longer a threat considering I got thrown like a dirty cum rag against the wall, they focus on papa bear. After he had about 5 guys clinging to his limbs and trying to restrain him, he decides he\\'s over me and goes back to his still-crying kid and frantic wife. I was then promptly picked up by the staff, carried out of the establishment and firmly told that I will be arrested on site if I come back.\\n\\nSupposedly after the incident they implemented a \"no under 21s allowed unless with parent supervision\" rule.\\n\\nTL;DR got drunk off beer with an empty stomach, projectile vomited onto a toddler, fist fought the dad, got banned from the establishment and got every other person under 21 banned as well unless with supervision.\\n\\n**Edit:** for those of you asking \"how the hell did you get alcohol at 19?\", I live in a country that\\'s legal drinking age is 18\\n\\n**Edit 2:** Obligatory *ThIsBlEwUp* edit, wow 10k updoots!

I personally do not like scratch offs, but my mother enjoys them and gives us her loser cards since the second chance process is sort of tedious.\\n\\nAwesome, right? Nope. The NCEL refuses to disburse winnings without a valid drivers license and social security card. My license and social security card are located in our apartment back near the coast, which experienced 5 feet of flood waters so far, and is close to collapsing in on itself.

I typed it up right after a pregnancy test.\\n\\nI\\'ll start with how I met my girlfriend. We were at a summer camp, (we\\'re both juniors) and things happened in that two week period that resulted in a relationship. To be frank, that was my first relationship, since prior to that I was much more focused on grades and education. It was your typical nerd fetish of \"landing the hot blonde\", although I was more thrown into the relationship, although once I was I relished it. However, she lives in Seattle, while I\\'m down in North Carolina, literally right off the path of Florence (which I really hoped and still hope would/will come and kill me). We \"dated\" halfway through the camp, a result of going off the college campus for eating. When we finished, I met her parents as they picked her up, but she never met mine. As a result, my parents never knew anything-- in fact, nobody did except for one of my friends who went on the cruise trip directly following, and basically everyone she knew. This never seemed to be really important for me, since I\\'m new to all this relationship stuff. Actually my friend who commonly browses reddit and my user will probably see this, so when I ride the school bus tomorrow I might be cucked even more.\\n\\nSpeaking of Hurricane Florence, it was actually the reason she came over; for, two days ago, with odd motives, she had traveled over to Wilmington rather than California for the beach with a group of her friends, and obviously was in direct path of the storm. With nowhere else to go, they ran towards the RDU triangle, which was the \"clear zone\" of the storm and rented a hotel. Me, seeing her story on Instagram, was an idiot and offered to give her stay. This was basically me, someone who pokes his friends with pencils (it was studying for AP Psych last year) thinking about others before him. Before my numbskull could realize that 1). she would be staying with my parents, who had ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA that she existed, 2). I would be living with a girlfriend I haven\\'t seen in about two months, who lives normally halfway across the country, and 3). events like these typically result in disaster, she replied with a \"Sure, thanks!\" and my plan was underway. Then I realized all these three shit points, but I was too scared to send these back because I\\'m an introvert and I don\\'t want to lose the closest thing I have to a relationship because I\\'m insecure and use HTTPS Everywhere. \\n\\nI then proceeded to start telling my parents about this, where my dad just sat there silent and looking amused why my mom was getting increasingly infuriated. After I finished (the story during which my mother interjected MULTIPLE times) my mom seemed more mad about how I never told her about this person rather than their stay here. My dad, on the other hand, seemed more relieved that I wasn\\'t a complete social outcast and a homosexual (because from his time, especially where he comes from, China, this is kinda big) and let it pass, which was the complete opposite of what I was thinking. My mom at that point proceeded to start trying to gossip, etc. about this stuff because parents. About two hours later, she arrived, and we (I) unpackaged her stuff into my room. \\n\\nNow the first night we didn\\'t do anything really, just slept (me for about 3 hours) but the second night we did; I actually blame the person at my camp for giving me an way oversized condom because I brought Cards Against Humanity over and he had multiple condoms to give out. I had never planned on having sex as a high school student because I am semi-socially awkward and the only girl I relatively knew were my 6 year old sister and my girlfriend. As a result, the only condom I had was one that was ridiculously oversized. Confession: I do NOT have a 10-inch dick. As a result, with the reassurances of a condom and probably not having the chance for the next ten years until I remember Tinder,  we decided to set upon yesterday. This ended with the condom leaking, and some surprise and stress, followed up by a pregnancy test which resulted in a positive. In fact, so far we two are the only ones that know about this (unless she\\'s putting this on her snapchat story) and putting it up here is more like an anonymity breaker. \\n\\n**TL;DR:** I met a girl at camp (both juniors) who lives on the opposite coast of me, who came over for vacation which was the first time my parents met her, got hurricaned into my home and got pregnant as a result. Nobody else knows.\\n\\nEDIT 1: So apparently I know nothing about Sex Ed because I was busy playing Clash Royale when I was in that class... I\\'m gonna go look at a doctor to make sure that the baby isn\\'t real, because, according to the helpful and supporting comments, the only possible causes were a prior pregnancy and a really shitty test. I kinda just overreacted and posted this, literally a tifu within a tifu. Thanks for those who gave me information and brought me out of stress mode!\\n\\nEDIT 2: So I told her about the entire doctor thing (and apparently she doesn\\'t understand how babies work either) and about how I was gonna schedule an appointment; she stayed silent for about thirty minutes and said that it was all a prank; etc. Obviously, this feels like a scam, so should i immediately dump, or entertain this further? Thanks again to all of your support during this!\\n\\nEDIT 3: Thanks to /u/FlagShack for the gold, even though I don\\'t feel like this post deserves it... really I\\'ve learned my lesson and deserve a fucking whopping for the idiocy of not listening in sex ed.',\n",

Throwaway because some IRL folks know my normal handle on here.\\n\\n\\nSo a couple of months ago my doctor put me on a new SSRI to help with my chronic depression. It didn\\'t work that well and made me super-dazed, and on top of that my sex drive dried up to a level that can only be described as \"Sahara-like.\" Now, it\\'s not like I\\'m in a relationship or anything, but I still enjoyed getting off at least a couple times a week, and found myself very wound up without my normal release.\\n\\n\\nI told my doctor that the medication just kind of put me in a fog, so she switched me to an SNRI and holy horniness my sex drive came back with a vengeance. After work one day, I came home and decided to treat myself to a round or two with my vibrator, to celebrate. Well, it had been building up so long in me that I went to town and had one of the most intense orgasms of my life. I should note at this point that I didn\\'t use lube, because I was so..worked up..I figured I didn\\'t need it.\\n\\n\\nSounds great, right? Eh..not so much, because right after finishing the deed, I realized I had a shooting pain in my vagina, like I had badly pulled a muscle. After spending a couple of minutes laying in state, praying to every god and deity out there to make the pain subside, I made the long, labored waddle to the toilet, only to realize I was dripping a lot of blood, too. \\n\\n\\nBefore you ask, no, it was not shark week for me, so needless to say, I was surprised. Upon further inspection, I realized that I not only pulled a muscle deep in my lady parts that had me walking funny for a day, I suffered a vaginal tear due to my..vigor..as well. However, it was a lot more blood than any little tears I had had in the past, and prior to this, I never tore from masturbating, so I was convinced I really badly injured myself, and may need stitches.\\n\\n\\nI called my OB\\'s office and made an appointment, and I explained what happened, all while turning shade of purple that Barney the dinosaur would envy. My doctor took a look and welp, I was right, I needed stitches, and instructed me that in the future during any particularly-intense sessions, I should probably use lube, just to be safe. Ironically, now I now have to once again abstain from all sexual activity for a period of time, so I\\'m back to square one. \\n\\n\\nNeedless to say, the whole experience was not what I was expecting, and has been something I would prefer to not experience, ever again.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR Got super horny, overdid it during a solo session, and broke my vagina.\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for all the lube tips, guys.

For the enthusiasts, this was a 68 F100, rust in color with olive green shining through in a few areas. It looked like something a sex offender retired a decade ago.\\n\\n“Well she’s no panty dropper,” The haggard prior owner told me, “But she’ll get you from A to B most of the time. Don’t try to make it to C though”\\n\\nYoung and naïve, I was actually excited for this arrangement. I shelled out the $500 and drove her home. The absolute first thing my new ride needed was a cooler steering wheel. $40 at a parts store and a hacksaw later, I pretty much had a racecar. (We later spray-painted the number 7 on the doors and hood for good measure).\\n\\n\\\\-Stay with me, this gets great. (well better anyways)\\n\\nFast forward a day or so and it was time to take her on a trip into the city. Of course, I end up stalled at a busy intersection. I try to give her some gas, and the engine dies. *Of course* it won’t start back up. Rush hour, MIDDLE of the intersection with 4 lanes in every direction honking at me. Panic ensued as I tried to hop out and push it, a growing mob of furious motorists sharpening pitchforks.\\n\\nFortunately, my luck turned for the better as a police officer pulled up. This guy has the audacity to ask the typical cop question “What seems to be the problem?”\\n\\n“Not sure, I think they’re all trying to get somewhere...”\\n\\nHe didn’t seem to get the joke, and offered to use his car pushers to get me out if the intersection. (Things on the front of police cars for… Exactly this?) I told him if he wanted to mess up a perfectly good cop car, he was welcome to try. He seemed like a new guy and was grinning about getting to do cop stuff.\\n\\nSo off we went, a minor slam and we were rolling. I cranked the wheel hard left, it took all my might without the power steering. Remember the hacksaw/steering wheel thing? Well in my haste, this truly may have been the biggest TIFU moment. I had not installed the steering wheel with a lock-nut, so turning it hard enough left would cause it to literally unscrew. We were picking up speed when the wheel spun loose in my hand and sent me on a course straight for the massive light pole. Clearly, I did not have many options and put both feet hard on the brakes in hopes that the officer would get the message. Unbeknownst to me, he actually wasn’t pushing anymore, and must have been 2-3 feet behind me. This was a detriment to both of us as I felt a slam that jarred my back and made me bop my forehead on the loose fit steering wheel. I heard a quick sharp “BOMPP” of a car horn right when we impacted, so I speculate that is where his face made contact as well.\\n\\nThe officer stormed out of his police car, wiping his nose as he did that angry cop walk toward me. This guy was very obviously new at this point, as he seemed to word vomit cop things without actually getting anywhere. The corner of his mouth was bleeding slightly.\\n\\n“Get out of the vehicle! The fuck… what the hell are you thinking?”\\n\\n“Get back in your vehicle, we need to get this…P.O.S. off my road! NOW!”\\n\\nFortunately, I was able to use a tire iron to tighten the steering wheel back up while he was doing his thing, he finally figured out what was going on and stomped back to his vehicle for round 2. This time the gods blessed our voyage and I was able to creep it to a nearby parking lot. We both exited our vehicles and for a brief instant I thought we were going to brawl. The mood was right, the adrenaline was right, and the circumstances were right. I really thought we might fight.\\n\\n“This *thing…* is NOT safe to drive.”\\n\\n“Yeah I don’t think it’s going anywhere.”\\n\\n“Does it even have insurance? Where’s the license plate? Is it... registered?”\\n\\n“That’s literally where I was headed sir.”\\n\\n“Well… get it fixed first.. Jesus! And do I need to search the vehicle?” More cop vomit as I realize there’s a bong on the floorboards.\\n\\n“Uh no, it’s pretty boring, just broke truck stuff mostly”\\n\\nHe said something else as he turned and cop-stomped back to his crown vic. I took a quick peek at his car and was surprised at how mangled his car pushers were. Aside from that the damage was minimal. Of course, ol’ rickety had no noticeable damage, and started right up when I got back behind the wheel.\\n\\nTL;DR – Broke down in a busy intersection, had to have a cop push me, steering wheel came off, had to hit the brakes, cop crashed into me. *Gave his face a schoolin.*\\n\\nPRE-EDIT – I drove it for several months and ended up totaling it in a similarly comical fashion. If viewers would like, I’ll gladly write it up.\\n\\nEDIT - To dampen off the death threats, yes the original steering wheel was spindled. The replacement was not. Google autozone steering wheel. It requires some sort of dimpled locking washer. The original being ancient required a pump puller to remove. The arms going from the center out to the steering handle parts were in the way and had to be hacked off. Does that make more sense? Please stop threatening to kill my family. Just assume it makes sense.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEDIT 2: Requested crashing posted [Here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/9gtr6x/tifu_by_wrecking_ol_rickety_a_followup_fuckup/)\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;',\n",

       "                          '9ho3ez': ['While overseas, one of the things we were charged with doing on a regular basis was disposing of insane amounts of illegal drugs. We usually were most concerned with the opium/poppy industry; however, a larger pot bust was enough to give us something to do. Typically, we would raid a compound and find a couple 100 lb sacks of ground marijuana. Enough pot for a lifetime. The pot fields grow wild out there, football fields in size, and 8-10 feet tall. Sometimes taller. It’s grown in a way that corn is grown in the civilized world, with irrigation and pesticides. It’s a remarkable sight. \\n\\nFor those of you who have read my prior posts that mention marijuana use, I would like to clarify… I never touched the stuff overseas. Far too terrifying. They also mix pot with chicken poop and various other things so there’s another reason to steer clear.\\n\\nAnyways, usually we just covered a couple hundred pounds of ground pot in diesel fuel, lit it on fire and went home. Far too risky to hang around and wait for it to burn. Well one day while searching a suspected HME (explosives) manufacturing house, we happened upon a room that had 7 or 8 100-pound bags (320 kg) of the sticky icky. If you know anything about pot, you know its fluffy. 700+ pounds was an absolute mountain. My mind reeled at how much money this would be worth back home. A literal fortune. This looked like The Hulk fell into a wood chipper. \\n\\nA genius counterpart suggested that we bring Mt. Kushamanjaro back to our base and burn it in our own burn pit, rather than leaving it here. \\n\\n“Well that’s a clever idea!” I thought, relieved that we wouldn’t have to risk getting ambushed with the biggest freaking smoke signal ever built. \\n\\nAh but ambushed, we were. The bags were loaded into pickup trucks and driven back to the base, hastily sliced open and dumped into the burn pit. I ran the idea by our leadership and we had a thumbs up all around. \\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe early effects weren’t bad. The smoke column went mostly straight up, however as it grew in size, it lazily pushed itself in the direction of the nearest guard tower, Tower 3. Jokes went around as we awaited the results. Coughing could be heard immediately and the private in Tower 3 called out to us: \\n\\n“Hey we need to…. We need to… do something… like… now?” I could hear the brain cells slowing with every word. \\n\\nThis was a churchy type kid, having never been exposed to the sticky.\\n\\n“Sergeant, I’m… I’m high as shit!” He yelled moments after. I panicked and sought a solution that would keep leadership out of it. \\n\\n“Someone, relieve him!” (genius)\\n\\nSeveral individuals raced to take over Tower 3. We devised a plan for a 10-minute rotation until the wind subsided. How perfectly that column of smoke engulfed the tower was perplexing. Like a lazy pot-nado. Around this time our fire really kicked up as the wind shifted and grew in intensity... right in the direction of the command post, and subsequently Tower 2. Several high-ranking leaders came out, looking furious. \\n\\n“Who the hell approved this!!?” The First Sergeant yelled\\n\\n“I believe you did..” The CO responded \\n\\n“Well where’s the detail that brought it in?” \\n\\n“That would be us First-Sergeant” Myself and a couple others. I thought back to the decision-making process and realized that I had a ton of responsibility in the matter. In fact, I was *really worried.* Abnormally concerned… I felt myself stammering over words, felt my heart begin to race, kept thinking “ohjesusohjesusohjesus I’m going to get caught...!” It was in that moment that I realized, I was sketching. I was proper baked, and not handling my shit well. \\n\\nI turned around and just sort of, left the conversation. My leaders did not need to see me drool. I hazily walked back toward Tower 3, ground zero, to find a dozen or so soldiers laying in each other’s laps, goofing off, and having a ‘deep philosophical conversation’ about a bug’s journey through life.\\n\\nInert.\\n\\nI wrote Tower 3 off as combat ineffective and wandered toward Tower 2 to see if I could help, a big stupid smile on my face. They seemed to be in better shape however were arguing about how long each should have to be in the tower. Apparently, the concept of time was no longer a thing. I started to address the issue with a random sergeant in the area, but we got side tracked in conversation about the effects of diesel fuel mixed with the pot. We theorized something stupid about how the diesel fuel had longer to soak in the smoke, and that it was causing the anger among the Tower 2 crew.\\n\\nI assume the wind was completely dead now, as I remember the whole compound being covered in a light haze. [**Here**](https://imgur.com/a/LVZQg8F) is a crude blueprint (greenprint?) of the above narrative.\\n\\nAt this point I thought it would be best to find a snack and wondered to our dining tent to see what was up. Here I was reunited with half my squad. Instead of relishing in the moment, there was a trouble cloud over our heads, and I could tell we were all pretending to be perfectly fine. Minus a couple phantom giggles, we did a pretty good job getting through a meal. \\n\\nAlthough I was personally quite effected, I think someone put the fire out, and a few hours later it was business as usual. A lot of stories flew around for months about the leadership getting high and what not. I did not personally see it. I came from ground zero, saw the leaders and returned to ground zero where I belonged. I theorize that my leaders took the same approach of handling it without involving their bosses. No repercussions followed.\\n\\n \\n\\nTL;DR – Tried to burn a bunch of contraband, the wind shifted and the contraband burned us.',\n",

However, because my boyfriend actively uses reddit and will most likely see this, I figured I'd do the respectful thing and wait two days before I posted this super flattering story.\\n\\n\\nSome important details to keep in mind:\\n\\n1. my boyfriend is deathly allergic to peanuts and has been since he was just a wee child.\\n\\n2. I'm a dumbass.\\n\\n\\n\\nSo, this past weekend marked our one-year anniversary, which is a huge feat in and of itself given detail #2 spelled out above. To celebrate, we decided to go out for a super fancy dinner -- the ol' OG Olive Garden.\\n\\n\\nBeing a fourth-year student at university, I've gotten very used to not wearing makeup, but I decided to go all out for our anniversary dinner. I even went out and bought a lip-plumping gloss so my bf could pretend he was dating a Kardashian for the day instead of plain old u/kate-plus-self-hate. Supposedly, the gloss works by searing your lips until they are huge, red, numb, and possibly burned to the first degree -- needless to say, it was unpleasant to use but I still thought it was worth it.\\n\\n\\nFast forward to my boyfriend picking me up and us detouring to an empty parking lot for a quick-ish makeout sesh. An hour later, we arrived at Olive Garden and started in on the unlimited soup, salad, and breadsticks. We're maybe 15 minutes into dinner, and my bf starts complaining that his lips are tingling and that he feels kind of funny. I think nothing of it at first, but as we keep eating, he says the feeling was getting more intense and was spreading to his neck, abdomen, and *nervous glance* his nether regions.\\n\\n\\nMy first thought was that he was hamming things up, but after a few minutes I could tell he wasn't faking anything. My next logical thought was that our food had come in contact with peanuts and that he was starting to have an allergic reaction. He agreed because he couldn't think of any other reason he would be experiencing the symptoms that he was.\\n\\n\\nAt this point, I'm starting to freak out -- I don't want to be responsible for killing the only human who voluntarily spends time with me -- so I take my bf's keys and race out to his car. I knew he kept an emergency EpiPen in his glove box, so I fished that out, ran back into the restaurant, and jammed that fucker into his thigh.\\n\\n\\nFast forwarding one more time, I flagged down our waiter to pay for our check, rushed my bf back out to his car, and drove like a maniac to the closest open urgent care facility. The practitioner there ran tests for his white blood cell counts and all of that fun shit, after which she told him that he's just fine and that none of their tests came back that he was having an allergic reaction. She asked him if he had come into contact with anything that might have been irritating his skin...\\n\\n\\n...and that's when my last two functioning brain cells decided to start working. The whole thing was my fault. The only possible explanation for the whole ordeal was that I got my probably-FDA-rejected lip plumping gloss all over my boyfriend's body.\\n\\n\\nMy bf was less than enthused when we got home and I told him what I thought had happened. In fact, he made me throw the gloss out immediately. A few hours later, he (and my own lips) went back to normal, but at least this makes for an anniversary we won't forget...\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: I mistook my getting lip plumping gloss all over my boyfriend for him dying from a peanut allergy.\"]}),\n",

I got home from working out of town Thursday night and my wife warns me that there is a problem with my 7 year old daughter. “Beth” comes in and I can see that she has a few bug bites on her face and and one of her eyelids is a little droopy. She feels fine though. \\n\\nI am off work the next day and my wife is going to the office. I wake Beth up for breakfast and her eye is now much worse. It is more than half closed and a little red. She still feels fine. As soon as the doctor opens, I call them and they tell us to come in.  \\n\\nWe get there and I go to check in. The receptionist that I have never seen looks at my daughter and says “Oh. My goodness, what happened?”  So I respond as a joke “Eh, she got out of line”.   \\n\\nI know!  It’s horrible. I’m sorry!  I have a weird sense of humor and I’m a bit socially awkward.  Anyway, we all smile and giggle before we head to the waiting area.  Soon we are called in. The checkup goes as expected. It’s a reaction to the bug bites and he tells me to use some over the counter Zyrtec or Benadryl.  Then there is a knock on the door and the doctor steps out. \\n\\nHe comes back in a few minutes later and says that the police would like to talk to me. The doctor is angry. We all head to the Doctor’s office to talk.  \\n\\nThere is a policeman and a policewoman. The policewoman starts making small talk with my daughter and asks if she wants to go in the other room and read a book. My daughter has an irrational fear of the police from when her older brother would threaten to call them whenever she went in his room.  So she says no and buries her face in my side.  The police then tell me that it is better that she is in another room. I saw one of Beth’s cheer coaches bring her son in soon after we got there and mention that she may still be there to watch her. The doctor, still visibly angry goes to check and she is so Beth goes to sit with her in the waiting room. \\n\\nThe police explain that they have a report of possible child abuse. The Doctor explains that this was a simple misunderstanding. He just examined my daughter and there is no abuse.  I now realize that it is the receptionist that he is angry with.  She makes an excuse and leaves the room. He says that he thinks he has to let her go. He says this is the second incident in 2 weeks. He says that her bad judgement got his practice and the entire executive park closed for 4 hours last week and his neighbors now hate him. \\n\\nThe police are apologetic but say they need to do a full investigation and ask if I can come to the station.  A friend comes to pick up my daughter who is freaking out at this point. \\n\\nWe get to the station (they allow me to drive there myself) and my Uncle who is a lawyer meets me there.   The police are apologetic and say they already know what happened but a full investigation and report need to be done. They say it is a minimum of 3-5 days, maybe longer.  I call my wife who goes ballistic.  \\n\\nThe county attorney says that they normally seek restraining orders in these cases, but if I sign an agreement to stay away from my daughter until the investigation is closed they would not seek one. My uncle recommends this as the restraining order would be public record. I stay at my brothers for the weekend and schedule an out of town trip that I really don’t need to make for this week.  I can’t wait to get home to see my family and sleep in my own bed but I’m pretty sure my wife will have me on the couch for a little while.  \\n\\ntl/dr:  Made a bad joke, got investigated for hitting my kid, lost the right to see her.

I wanted to answer some of the questions that you guys had.  I want to thank all of you guys for the kind words and support.  For those of you saying that I am an idiot, you are probably right.\\n\\n1) I will not be sleeping on the couch.  My wife got over this fairly quickly and is no longer angry.  At least not at me.\\n\\n2) I am heading home from Boston tomorrow evening and I think everything should be resolved by then.\\n\\n3) I will not be taking legal action against the receptionist.  She was very young did not do this out of animosity. I do not know what if anything will happen to her job. I am not pushing for her to lose it.  \\n\\n4) The other story about the receptionist goes like this (as told to me by the doctor).  A few weeks ago the lights in the parking lot of the executive park blew and the landlord had trouble getting them fixed so he rented temporary light stanchions for the businesses that are open past sundown until they could figure out the problem.  These lights apparently ran on gas or diesel.  The receptionist came back from lunch one day and smelled something so she called the state\\'s department of environmental protection to say that she believed that there was a fuel leak.   The DEP closed the parking lot for the rest of the day for \"clean up\".  It turned out to be nothing.']}),\n",

He has lived in the city quite a while, where I moved here while he finishes school from a town in Wyoming where we don’t lock our doors and our bikes sit on our lawns.

I also have a cold, so I had been blowing my nose pretty frequently throughout the shift.\\n\\nThere were about 30 minutes left in my shift, and I could feel my nose about to drip. I was out of kleenex, so I got up to grab a napkin from the corner. As I\\'m blowing my nose, I feel a weird feeling in my head. Immediately, I recalled a family friend of mine who had a brain aneurysm triggered by blowing her nose. I know it\\'s ridiculous (which I\\'m realizing even more as I type this out), but because that\\'s what my head immediately went to, I just had to know what the symptoms of a brain aneurysm might be.\\n\\nI did a Google search, and the first thing I read was \"An unruptured aneurysm usually causes no symptoms.\" Now, I\\'m someone who gets queasy at anything medical like this, but this was a new record. After reading this, I thought to myself \"oh fuck\", and then proceeded to tunnel-vision. My last thought was \"shit I think I\\'m gonna fain---\"\\n\\nNext thing I know I was being helped across the room by another TA in the room, and I had no idea what had happened yet. As I get to the other side of the room, another TA comes in with a medical student (the med college was in the same building), and this guy asks me to lay down on the ground. He asks me to lay down on the ground, and that\\'s when I notice my hand covered in blood. I start to panic, and when I try to sit up, I immediately started to tunnel-vision again, so I quickly put my head back down to keep from fainting again. Then they covered my brow with paper towel, which indicated to me where I hit my head. I was asked questions such as \"what day is it today\" and \"who is our president,\" both of which I knew.\\n\\nOverall it was a wild series of events. EMTs were called, and ambulance was sent to my location. A few friends of mine were in the building, and they came to make sure I was okay. After ten minutes or so I felt fine aside from being a little shaky after everything had happened, and a hospital stretcher was brought in. \\'*Shit*\\' I thought, as I know how much an ambulance trip costs and idk jack shit about my family\\'s health insurance policy. To make matters worse, half of the people in the room thought I should go to the ER to make sure everything was okay, and the other half told me that I was fine and didn\\'t need it. Still in shock, I opted not to go, and I\\'ve felt fine ever since aside from a bit of a headache from hitting my head.\\n\\nAfter everything went down, my understanding is that I fell out of my chair and hit my head on the wheel of a table in the room. I was out for about 20 seconds, and I clearly scared the living shit out of the other TAs that were there. Overall though, I was very impressed with how the situation was handled. The other TAs were quick to get multiple sources of help, and the med student had arrived by the time I came to. He was very knowledgeable and was able to replicate many of the questions the EMT had asked me when he got there. I\\'m just glad to say that I wasn\\'t alone when I fainted, otherwise I might not still be here. Anyways, I\\'ll probably will be taking the day to relax tomorrow.\\n\\nTL;DR: Felt a unique feeling in my head after blowing my nose, googled brain aneurysm symptoms, and got queasy and fainted. Hit my head hard on the wheel of a table and almost got sent to the ER.']}),\n",

It looked horrible as well. The brilliant idea came to use callous remover (it removes dead skin, right?) to take off the outer layer that was falling off.\\n\\nIt worked... in a sense. I put the callous remover in latex gloves, rubbed it around to distribute it around, then put my hands in. I planned to leave them in for 5 minutes. After about 1 minute, a searing pain began to shoot up my arms. I ripped off the gloves and ran to wash my hands. I felt satisfied for a moment as I saw dead skin collecting in the bottom of the sink; however, my mood dropped when I noticed how red my hands looked. The callous remover did its job, removing a layer or two of skin. My hands would no longer be peeling. The problem was that every small crevice in my hand, every wrinkle, and every groove deeper than a fingerprint ridge began to bleed. I tried to clean my hands and the pain increased. They had to be carefully dried and wrapped.\\n\\nImagine a paper cut. Now, imagine a paper cut between the webs of your fingers. Now imagine thousands of paper cuts in all the grooves of your hands. I was unable to move my fingers without reopening the cuts and restarting all the pain. I could not type, text, open a door, write, pick up a book, or grab in any significant way without more pain. I remained in that state for three days. Then I could begin to do minor tasks. Now, more than two weeks later, I feel fine to type this story.\\n\\nTL;DR I used callous remover to remove the skin on my hands. It did, and my hands bled with the pain of a thousand paper cuts.',\n",

No diabetes, regular blood pressure so am generally in okay health.\\n\\nWent to the blood bank to drop my quarterly 500cc of blood. Usually i hydrate real well and have a decent meal after to help replenish. But that day, i got a call from work ( i drop by in my lunch break) and had to rush back. So rather than a sit down meal with lots of veggies and protein i grab a glazed donut and whatever came in a bottle to go. They didn\\'t have water so i grabbed like so soda like thing, i dont even remember, anyhoo it was laden with sugar.\\n\\nImmediately i felt the buzz of the sugar high. So for the rest of the day i am feeling a little light headed ( slightly normal after I donate), but also slightly nauseous and a little on edge.\\n\\nI go home and for whatever reason i am pretty turned on, so as soon as i can i seduce the missus and we get it on.\\n\\nNow, i pause here to add that after donating blood, i am usually advised to not do vigorous exercise lift weights for 48-72 hrs. Now i have broken all the rules, am dehydrated, experience hyperglycaemia and i\\'m pushing my blood and heart to do some serious cardio.\\n\\nSo, we\\'re doing the deed, its going good, i am slightly delirious and then boom i puke out lunch and dinner on my wife and she tells me i just collapse on her after.\\n\\nI of course don\\'t remem ber any of this but i wake up in the ER with a drip and a very cross wife with puke stained hair staring at me.

Apparently if I wasn\\'t qyite so healthy, the self induced hyperglycemia  could have resulted in a coma or possible blown blood vessel somewhere like my brain.\\n\\nTl:dr donated blood, didnt rehydrate, took too much sugar, had sex, nearly had a stroke.\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit 3: wow this blew up. Okay a few things. First of all thank you all for the concern, diabetes is hereditary in my family. I get tested regularly but after this episode i am getting a full physical just to be sure. We told the doctor i was \"working out\", and he just nodded. He thinks its a confluence  of too much sugary stuff ( i didnt eat that much proper food that day), fatigue (i hadnt been sleeping much coz of work), dehydration, and the blood loss. \\n\\nAnd yes my wife has forgiven me, she is my wife after all. She finds the \"fucked him out of his mind\" brag really funny. And she assures me we can have sexy time as long as i use a horses feedbag.\\n\\nLastly, PSA: i am still going to keep donating blood. Doctor said he doesnt see why not unless the physical says otherwise. Please consider donating if you have not. It saves lives and blood banks are always running low. If you take away anything from my TIFU its that giving blood while \"risky\" is totally worth it, had sex right ;)\\n\\nEdit 4: wow thank you for the gold kind stranger!',\n",

Each day is about a 14 hour day. Naturally, I decided to have a nice long relaxing shower before I left. \\n\\nAbout 4 mins into my planned 25min shower, I was midway through shampooing my hair when I felt something. Like a sixth sense something-ain’t-quite-right-here type of something. I look up above me, and to my HORROR, a black, eight-legged, piece-of-shit, shower-ruining, house spider dropping down its web towards me via the air vent.\\n\\nAustralian children are taught very young to stay away from spiders. It’s common knowledge that the black ones can cause extreme pain, seizures, death, so I know my daycare teachers would be proud seeing my 6’2, 91kg, naked male body glide through my sliding shower doors and onto the tile floor, covered in shampoo.\\n\\nThey’d be extra proud of me, without thinking, grabbing the toxic insect spray, and proceeding to blast the shower and spider, with a fallout cloud that would rival the scene from T2: Judgement Day. \\n\\nThey would NOT be proud of me, however, of being so paranoid about seeing the spider die, that I stood in the enclosed, steamy room, inhaling the fumes to see it. It wasn’t until I realised my eyes were watering and I could smell a stinging sensation that I realised I had unintentionally gassed myself. \\n\\nSo my naked, wet, bloodshot-eyed, dumbass attempted to run out of the bathroom, to escape dying via ALDI cheap bug spray.

Worth mentioning was that I hadn’t felt the need to poo for a full week. \\n\\nTo understand the importance of that statement, one has to understand that at the time I would take a crap regularly, as in once a day every day. So when I wasn’t clearing my pipes, it was a matter for concern. \\n\\nBack to the morning of February 23, I was in pain. I couldn’t sit up straight at school, I was constantly grunting to cope, but after the first few periods I was managing and it didn’t hurt me too much. When school was out, I was feeling like cash money, and decided I wanted to take a nap. Generally I don’t like to wear a shirt at home, but at the time I was very into inspecting my abdomen to see how it was shaping up. Classic teenage boy things. \\n\\nAnyways, after emptying the old trouser snake, I looked at my mirror and gave my midsection a peek. Instead of the sight of my normally rather flat stomach, I was greeted to my body being curved. The left side of my body was considerably more concave than the right, and that’s where it lined up with the hurt in my back. Panic ensued as I informed my mother. \\n\\nFast forward a half hour, and I’m being inspected at a clinic. Of course, the doctors there are quite perplexed, and I need an x-ray. They inform me that I should probably head to the ER, since they don’t know what to do. \\n\\nAt the ER, I of course get another x-ray. They wheel me around in a wheelchair, where I’m comically hunched to the side like the crooked man. I get scanned and it’s back to a hospital bed with me. Eventually, they pull my mother out to ask her a few questions and tell her what they think. At that point I’m going a mile minute, absolutely terrified of what it could be. One nurse mentioned kidney stones, which also happen to be one of my biggest fears. \\n\\nImagine my surprise when my mom walks in with the doctor and asks me when the last time I “took a crap” was. I tried to recall and realized that I in fact could not remember. It was at that point the doctor informed me that I was absolutely filled with stool. I of course laughed, which hurt like the dickens. They gave me a muscle relaxant, pain killers, and a prescribed stool softener. \\n\\nThe next few days were spent with me trying to drop a deuce after drinking a cup of water mixed with powdered laxative. I was met with the sounds of rushing air and no real substance time and time again, until finally the gates opened and I took my first real number 2 in days. \\n\\nTo add to it, the more matter I defecated, the more relaxed the muscle became the straighter my body, so I was on a personal mission to push like my life depended on it. \\n\\n\\nTl;Dr I ended up in the hospital because I couldn’t give a shit and ended up spasming one of my back muscles. This was only remedied after days of trying to push some crap out with the help of medication. \\n\\nEdit from the toilet: It’s kinda wild how many people have said they’ve had a similar or the same problem. We all need to fix our diets. \\n\\nTo clarify, what proooobably did it was me eating Mini Wheats cereal every morning for breakfast, a single Nutella to go every lunch, and then whatever my mother made for dinner which tends to be high in protein, medium in carbs, and little fiber. I would also sneak a solid bowl or two after school of Mini Wheats for Second Lunch. Love me some Mini Wheats.  ',\n",

Being the good boys that we were we promised them we would not invite our friends over. This was really the first time that my parents had left my brother and I alone at the house for more than a few days so they really had to put their faith in us.\\n\\nAfter several days of them being gone, I suddenly realized that they would have no clue if my friends came over while they were on such a remote island. I didn\\'t have to tell them anything. While my brother was at work and I texted my friends and told them to come over to our house to wait for my brother to come home so that we could all do something together.\\n\\nI was halfway through the Dark Knight when my friends came over so we decided to finish that while we waited for my brother. My brother ended up getting a longer shift so in our boredom we decided we wanted to prank him when he got home. My friend suggested that we move everything in his room two inches to the left to see if that would mess with him. I then got the bright idea that not only should we do that, but we should move everything in the house two inches to the left.\\n\\nAfter one room of this prank, we decided it was lame so I came up with another idea. I told them, \"What if we flipped over everything in the house and made it look like the house got broken into so that my brother freaks out when he comes home.\" So we did just that. We turned over couches, beds, and chairs. We broke light bulbs on the ground. We even took all of the valuable items in the house and placed them in my truck and then drove it around the block. Honestly if we were trying to make a movie set of a house that got broken in to, we nailed it. I opened the garage half way to make it seem like someone had gotten in that way. I then turned off all of the lights and got out a super bright flashlight.\\n\\nI called my brother and told him that I would be staying with some family friends that night so he would have to hold down the fort himself. My plan was, when my bother opened the door I would shine my flashlight in his eyes and then would run out of the garage and he would see all of the damage in the house and freak out for a minute. Then I would tell him it was all a joke. That is not what happened.\\n\\nWhen my brother got home, he called me and asked me if I had left the garage door open. I told him maybe and that he should just shut it when he got inside. He got pretty spooked by the entire house being completely dark and did not go in right away like I thought he would. Then I accidentally turned on the flash light and he saw it. The moment he saw that he called the police and told them our house was being robbed.\\n\\nI called him and told him it was just a prank. He said he had already called the police. I said, \"Well Un-call them!\" but it was too late. My brother came in the house and we decided to clean the house up before they came so it looked like we were not robbing the place. We knew we were hosed when we saw the blue and red lights in front of our driveway. The officers came up to the door and knocked super loudly and said to come out with our hands up. We obeyed and then they told us to get on our knees in the front lawn. They told us that the guns they were pointing at us were loaded and that if we moved we would be shot.\\n\\nI was so scared that they would count the uncontrollable shaking of my body as moving. I told them, \"It was all a prank officer!\" and he yelled back, \"I don\\'t give a fuck!\". He questioned us for about fifteen minutes with the gun on us while his partner searched the house. After awhile our neighbor came outside and screamed, \"No don\\'t shoot those boys! They are good kids!\" They questioned her for awhile and finally told us that we were the stupidest fucking kids alive and that they never wanted to come back to our house again.\\n\\nWe thanked our neighbor for saving us and then went back to \"sleep\".

Definitely one of the dumbest things I have done in my life.\\n\\nTL;DR-Tried to play a prank on my brother by making it seem like their were thieves in my house when he got home from work.

Our neighbor came to save us. We realized we were the dumbest fucking kids alive.\\n\\nEDITS:\\n1. Because this question has been asked alot: Yes my parents found out.

I grew up middle class with a very simple family. Right now, I’m traveling for work for a few weeks, so naturally I expected to do laundry at some point. I figured most Hilton’s have guest laundry so this shouldn’t be a problem. \\n\\nAs I’m checking in I ask the front desk, “Do you have guest laundry or like, quarter laundry nearby?” \\n\\nHe goes on to tell me they don’t have quarter laundry but their Hilton does have guest laundry. I’d just leave my shit with him and they’d have it done by that evening. \\n\\nMe, being the simpleton I am, thinks it’s complimentary. To be fair, HE SHOULD HAVE MENTIONED IT COST A LOT OF MONEY. I mean, based on my reaction alone, that should’ve been some indicator that I was not the type to drop hundos on fucking laundry. Christ, I just asked where the local laundromat was. Of course I don’t have that sort of money. Plus, after he said that, I literally jerked my head back and was like, “Really? How does that work?” And proceeded to have a lengthy conversation on how nice it was they did that and how I never did anything like that before and felt so fancy. Not once did he mention cost. Even after I dropped off my huge bag of crumpled up laundry he didn’t say a word. Hindsight, of course it cost money. But to me, in that moment, it sounded like they just did complimentary laundry for their guests. I figured most people didn’t use the service since they typically just stayed at the hotel a night or two. It was probably used mostly by few people like me who traveled for work. Maybe I’m dumb, but still. He should have mentioned a cost. \\n\\nSo I go about my day. Get back to the hotel. Get my laundry and thank the girl. The guy I had talked to before was gone now and it was a new person. As I’m leaving she says, “I’ll just add the cost to your room.” \\n\\nI’m taken aback but it happens so fast that I just smile and nod and go to my room. The entire walk up I’m replaying her words in my head. Cost? What cost? It wasn’t until I got to my room that I started to panic. I raced right back downstairs and asked what she meant by that. She explained that it cost money to do the laundry service. They charged by clothing item and my total was $300 and some change!! The real fucking kicker is that they didn’t even wash nice clothes. Among the laundry was my nasty cut off sleeves gym work out shirt and gym shorts, and my nasty hole-ridden work out socks. It was weird seeing those hung up like they were a goddamn ball gown. \\n\\nNow, I was raised to be polite, so I made sure to tell her I’m not at all mad at her since it’s not her fault, but WHAT THE FUCK???  I’m proud to say I kept my composure the entire time, but I felt like crying. I still sort of do. She gave me the number to her manager, and I sent him an email yesterday afternoon. He works on Monday, so I’m definitely going to stop in and see if there is ANYTHING they can do to wipe that charge or discount it. I travel a lot for work so I have a crap ton of Hilton honors points. Enough for a two night stay in a nice hotel. I’m hoping I can just trade that in or *something.* My job definitely doesn’t cover that cost, and I most certainly don’t have that kind of dough. Not sure what I’m going to do. If anyone has any suggestions I’d be grateful for help. Unless I’m completely fucked.... \\n\\nTl;dr - I thought guest laundry was complimentary. It is, in fact, not. Got a $300 bill when I could’ve just spent five bucks in quarters doing my own damn laundry. \\n\\n\\n**UPDATE**\\n\\nThis isn\\'t a super exciting update, but I thought I\\'d keep you all in the loop. I received an e-mail early this morning from one of the managers at Hilton in reply to the frantic e-mail I sent after the \"incident.\" She is \"happy to work with me on the balance\" but I don\\'t quite know what this means yet as the e-mail was pretty vague. Could be anything from a full refund, to knocking ten dollars off, or a voucher, or something like that. She also asked me what amount I could pay towards the $300 bill. \\n\\nIn my head, I was like *\"uhhhh how bout free-fifty yo,\"* but I realized that getting away with paying a reduced rate is more than fair and she was super generous to even offer that. Realistically, if I can get this down to $50, I\\'d be happy. I mean, I\\'d be happy with anything at all, but 50 bones would allow me to rest easy at night. \\n\\nSo I decided to reply. \\n\\nI thought about it, and instead of listing a number I\\'d contribute toward the total, I chose to give her a more detailed account of what had happened. You see, email number one was written when I was tweaking out on adrenaline after this all originally transpired. I didn\\'t do a good job of explaining how I was mislead, or how I didn\\'t fill out any forms, and instead sounded like some frantic teenage girl who\\'d just gotten her first speeding ticket. So I pretty much shared the story that I did with you all, but spiffed it up with some grown-up words. At the end, I said something along the lines of, \"In regards to how much I can pay toward the $300 bill--I was prepared to spend $5 in quarters for my laundry that afternoon (haha). I\\'m willing to work with you on the price, but I am unable to spend anywhere near $300 for laundry.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s good right?! I have no idea as I\\'m horrible at this sort of thing. I\\'m so bad at balancing politeness with sternness; I always lean toward to nice, so when I try to be stern I either am not stern enough or am like Winston from New Girl and take it too far. I hate complaining and causing problems!! But I hate being out $300 dollars more, so I bit the bullet. Anyway, I sent that e-mail maybe five hours ago. My original plan was to go to the hotel this afternoon and sort this out, but since I\\'d received that e-mail, I thought I\\'d hold off to see if we could solve it that way. If I don\\'t hear back by tomorrow afternoon, I will definitely go down there after work. I held off because I felt like marching down there hours after getting an e-mail was a bit aggressive. I\\'m in Houston for the week (staying at a different hotel) so it\\'s no trouble for me to make the trip.\\n\\nAnyway, that\\'s what\\'s up!! I\\'m hoping she just e-mails me this afternoon, and I can be done with all this drama. Shout out to all the Redditors who offered to help me pay the bill. That\\'s insanely nice of you and it fills me with joy to know there are such kind strangers in this world. However, I could never accept payment from strangers for my own fuck up. \\n\\n\\nThanks for all the support and advice!! I really appreciate it. \\n\\n\\n',\n",
